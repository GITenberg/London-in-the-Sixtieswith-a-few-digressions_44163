<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>CHAPTER
I.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">1860.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">London</span> in the sixties was so
different from the London of to-day that, looking back through
the long vista of years, one is astonished at the gradual
changes&mdash;unnoticed as they proceed.&nbsp; Streets have been
annihilated and transformed into boulevards; churches have been
removed and flats substituted; night houses and comfortable
taverns demolished and transformed into plate-glass abominations
run by foreigners and Jews, whilst hulking louts in uniform,
electro-plate and the shabby-genteel masher have taken the place
of solid silver spoons and a higher type of humanity.&nbsp; So
extensive indeed has been the transformation, that, if any
night-bird of those naughty days were suddenly exhumed, and let
loose in Soho, he would assuredly wander into a church in his
search of a popular resort, and having come to scoff, might
remain to pray, and so unwittingly fall into the goody-goody ways
that make up our present monotonous existence.</p>
<p>The highest in the land in those benighted days turned up
their coat collars and rubbed shoulders after dusk with others of
their species in recreations which, if indulged in now, would be
tantamount to social ostracism, or imperilling the
&ldquo;succession.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>It was,
in short, the tail end of the days of the Regency, changed,
virtuous reader, for better or worse.&nbsp; It was, nevertheless,
distinctly enjoyable and straightforward, for it showed its
worst, and blinked nothing in hypocrisy.</p>
<p>The only recommendation for this appearance is its
authenticity; every incident passed within (or very near) my ken,
for I was a veritable &ldquo;front-rank man&rdquo; in that
long-ago disbanded army&mdash;a veteran left behind when better
men have passed away&mdash;one of the few who could attend a
muster parade of that vast battalion of roysterers, and who, by
sheer physical strength, has survived what weaker constitutions
have succumbed to&mdash;a living contradiction of the theory of
the &ldquo;survival of the fittest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was one morning early in 1860 that I proudly saw my name in
the <i>Gazette</i>&mdash;as a full-blown ensign.&nbsp; I had
scanned every paper for weeks, although aware that our late
gracious Sovereign (or her deputy) could hardly have had time to
decide the momentous question as to whether I was to be a
fusilier, a rifleman, or a Highlander, so short was the period
between passing my examination and the announcement I so
fervently awaited.&nbsp; But I had great Army interest, and so it
came to pass that, within six weeks of leaving Chelsea Hospital
(where the examinations took place), I held a commission in a
distinguished regiment.</p>
<p>To give the number of the dear old corps would at best be
misleading, for numerals and the prestige that attached to them
were wiped out long ago by one scratch of the pen of that great
civilian who remodelled our Army from what it was when it
suppressed the Mutiny to what it became before the Boer War.</p>
<p>England at this period bristled with soldiers&mdash;bronzed
old warriors with beards down to their waists, who had not seen
their native shores for twelve or fifteen or twenty years; who,
till they were scraped (in conformity with St. James&rsquo;s
campaigning ideas), <a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>looked fit to do anything, or go anywhere&mdash;men who
had survived the trenches and the twenty degrees of frost in the
Crimea, and sweltered twelve months later at Gwalior, Jhansi,
Lucknow, and Delhi, and had at last found their reward, amidst
cocked hats, red tape, recruits&rsquo; drill, and discharge, in
that haven of rest, &ldquo;merrie England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My future regiment, then on its way home, was no exception to
the rule, and I remember, as but yesterday, the comparisons I
drew a few weeks later on the Barrack Square of the (then) new
barracks at Gosport, between the pasty-faced
&ldquo;strong-detachment&rdquo; from the dep&ocirc;t and the
grand old veterans that towered over them.</p>
<p>And every man-jack of them was possessed of valuable
jewels.&nbsp; Where the worthy rogues had captured the loot needs
not to inquire, suffice to say that oriental stones worth
hundreds were retailed for a few shillings, and found their way
to the coffers, and tended to build up the fortune, of an astute
Hebrew who, by &ldquo;the encouragement of British
industries,&rdquo; eventually became a knight, and died not long
ago in the odour of sanctity, rich and respected&mdash;as all
rich men do.</p>
<p>It was amid these surroundings that I began my military
career, despite the fact that every rascal with anything to sell
had radiated towards Gosport from every point of the compass.</p>
<p>Gosport and Portsmouth were in those days the first stepping
stones in the filtration towards Aldershot, after which, and only
after a drill season, the grandest soldiers England ever
possessed, were considered as presentable troops.</p>
<p>The barrack squares in those happy days, after a regiment had
landed, resembled oriental bazaars rather than the starchy,
adamant quadrangles familiar to the present generation.&nbsp;
Every forenoon officers and men were surrounded by hucksterers of
every care and creed, and one&rsquo;s very quarters were invaded
<a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>by Jews and
Gentiles anxious to sell or buy something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the most arakristic trap in the west of
England, so &rsquo;elp me Gawd; isn&rsquo;t it, Cyril?&rdquo; one
Hebrew would inquire of another, as the points of an ancient
buggy and a quadruped standing in the square were extolled to
ambitious youngsters; and &ldquo;Yes it is, so &rsquo;elp me
Gawd,&rdquo; often succeeded in selling a rattle-trap that had
done duty in every regiment stationed at Gosport from time
immemorial.&nbsp; Old clothes-dealers, too, abounded by the
score, ready to buy anything for next to nothing.&nbsp; But some
of us youngsters were not to be caught like the veterans who were
unfamiliar with dep&ocirc;t ways, and the judicious deposit of a
farthing in a pocket now and again resulted in phenomenal prices
for cast-off garments till the hucksterers &ldquo;tumbled,&rdquo;
and the harvests ended; and so, between the goose step and a
thousand other delights, the happiest days many of us ever
enjoyed (though unaware of it at the time) passed slowly on.</p>
<p>At this period the Volunteers had just come into existence,
and, not having developed the splendid qualities they proved
themselves possessed of during the Boer War, naturally came in
for considerable chaff and ridicule.</p>
<p>As a specimen of the senseless jokes that abounded at the
time, I may quote what was generally mooted in military messes,
that at a recent lev&eacute;e the volunteers who had attended had
shown so much <i>esprit de corps</i> that Her Majesty had ordered
the windows to be opened; and it is, I believe, an absolute fact
that on one occasion an inspecting officer nearly had a fit when
the major of a gallant corps appeared with the medal his prize
sow had won pinned upon his breast.</p>
<p>It was the Volunteer review in Hyde Park in 1860 that was
responsible for my first appearance in uniform.&nbsp; <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>Determined that
the review should lack nothing of military recognition, stands
had been erected, for which officers in uniform were entitled to
tickets for themselves and their relations.&nbsp; In an unlucky
moment the announcement had caught the eye of a sister, with the
result that, terribly nervous, nay almost defiant, I was marched
boldly down to Bond Street on the day of the review, and,
<i>nolens volens</i>, dressed at Ridpath and Manning&rsquo;s in
my brand new cast-iron uniform.</p>
<p>Conceive, kind reader, a wretched youth&mdash;dressed inch by
inch by a ruthless tailor in broad daylight on a sunny afternoon,
incapable of deceiving the most inexperienced by his amateur
attempts of appearing at home&mdash;huddled into the clothes, and
then hustled into the street by a proud sister and father, and
some idea of my abject misery will be apparent to you.</p>
<p>It was at the moment, whilst waiting on the pavement to enter
our carriage, that a huge Guardsman passed and thought fit to
&ldquo;salute.&rdquo;&nbsp; My first instinct was to wring him by
the hand and present him with a sovereign; then all became
indistinct, and I tumbled into the carriage.</p>
<p>The excitement was too much for me&mdash;I almost fainted.</p>
<p>A splendid specimen of the Hibernian type in my regiment was a
man called Madden (and by his familiars &ldquo;Payther&rdquo;),
who, as a character, deserves special mention.&nbsp; This giant
had not long previously been &ldquo;claimed&rdquo; by an elder
brother whilst serving in a Highland Regiment, and it was
reported that on one occasion, when on sentry at Lucknow, the
general officer impressed by his six feet three in full Highland
costume, having pulled up and addressed him with, &ldquo;What
part of the Highlands do you come from, my man?&rdquo; was
considerably nonplussed by being informed, &ldquo;Oi come from
Clonakilty, yer honour, in the County Cork.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our
colonel, too, was an <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>undoubted Irishman by birth; but had succeeded, after
forty years&rsquo; service, in being capable of assuming the
Scotch, Irish, or English dialect as circumstances seemed to
require.&nbsp; In addition, moreover, to an excessive amount of
<i>esprit de corps</i>, he had the reputation of being the
greatest liar in the Army; not a liar be it understood in the
offensive application of the term, but incapable of accuracy or
divesting his statements of exaggeration when notoriety or
circumstances gave him an opening.&nbsp; This failing of
&ldquo;Bill Sykes,&rdquo; as he was called, was so universally
known throughout the Army, that one evening a trap was laid for
him by some jovial spirits in the smoking-room of a famous Army
club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes old Bill,&rdquo; was remarked by Cootie, of
the Bays, as the Colonel sauntered in with a toothpick in his
mouth.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet a fiver I&rsquo;ll start a
yarn he&rsquo;ll never be able to cap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; cried Kirby, &ldquo;and if he
doesn&rsquo;t keep up his reputation I&rsquo;ll pay you on the
nail, and send in my papers in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Colonel,&rdquo; began Cootie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was just relating a most extraordinary coincidence that
was lately told me by a man whose veracity I can vouch
for&mdash;Shute of ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; replied the Colonel, filling a
pipe&mdash;Bill invariably smoked a dudeen at the head of the
regiment.&nbsp; &ldquo;By all means let me hear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is simply this.&nbsp; Coming home on sick leave in a
P. and O. not long ago, the look-out man descried half a mile out
at sea what appeared to be a huge box; a long boat was
immediately lowered, and when the derelict was brought on deck,
conceive the astonishment of everybody in discovering that it was
a hencoop, and a live man inside.&nbsp; It was a case of
shipwreck it appears, and the man saved was the only survivor of
some 180 souls.&nbsp; Rum thing, wasn&rsquo;t it? but some people
have infernal luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the Colonel.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
believe I was horn under a lucky star; perhaps you will be
surprised to hear that <i>I</i> was the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A roar of astonishment greeted this admission, whilst Cootie,
hastily thrusting a fiver into Kirby&rsquo;s hand, whispered,
&ldquo;I presume you won&rsquo;t send in your papers
to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, despite his peculiarity, old Bill was universally
popular.&nbsp; A splendid billiard player, he had in India
created such excitement in a match for &pound;500, that even Lord
Faulkland, the Governor of Bombay, who never parted with a
sixpence without looking at it twice, was said to have put a gold
mohur on it, and in later times I can remember the Club House at
Aldershot being crammed to suffocation when the same redoubtable
warrior licked Curry the Brigade Major, who till our arrival had
no compeer.</p>
<p>One curious experience he had had which he never tired of
narrating: &ldquo;I was once waiting for the d&mdash; packet at
Dover to take me over to Calais, and at the hostelry I met a
d&mdash; Frenchman, who asked me if I could &lsquo;parley
vous,&rsquo; and I said &lsquo;no,&rsquo; but offered to play him
a game of billiards.&nbsp; We had a fiver on it, but I soon
discovered that no matter where I left the balls the d&mdash;
fellow made a cannon.&nbsp; I was only about three ahead of him,
so when next I played I knocked a ball off the table.&nbsp; The
first time the d&mdash; fellow sympathised with me, and picked up
the ball; after two or three repetitions the coincidence appeared
to puzzle him.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t play if Mooser does
this,&rsquo; he said angrily.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t help
that,&rsquo; I replied, and ran out with a break.&nbsp; He
declined to go double or quits, so I pocketed the fiver, and
often found myself laughing over it in the d&mdash; boat, where I
was d&mdash; ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This persistent swearing may sound curious to the student of
to-day, but in those halcyon days everybody swore.&nbsp; The Iron
Duke, it is well known, never opened <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>his mouth without a superfluous
adjective, and General Pennefather, who commanded at Aldershot in
my time, literally &ldquo;swore himself&rdquo; into office.&nbsp;
On one occasion, when the Queen was on the ground, he wished
every regiment so vehemently to the &ldquo;bottom of the
bottomless pit&rdquo; that it frightened the gracious lady, who
sent an equerry to remind him of her presence.&nbsp; The monition
had the desired effect for ten minutes, when the bombardment
commenced afresh, and brought the field-day to an abrupt
termination.&nbsp; The Queen had bolted in sheer trepidation of
an earthquake.</p>
<p>Military examinations for direct commissions in those long-ago
days were held at Chelsea Hospital, and extended over a
week.&nbsp; On the occasion of my public appearance an
extraordinary incident occurred.&nbsp; Every precaution, it was
stated, had been taken against the papers getting into
unauthorised hands, but hardly had the first day passed when
every candidate was aware that the tout of a sporting tailor was
prepared to sell the paper of the day correctly answered at
&pound;2 a head.&nbsp; The conspirators met at the &ldquo;Hans
Hotel,&rdquo; and donkeys incapable of spelling, and with no
knowledge of any language but their own, passed examinations
worthy of a senior wrangler.</p>
<p>The miscreant who thus tampered with Her Majesty&rsquo;s
stationery was one Pugh, and his employer (if I remember rightly)
was one Cutler; but the golden shower came to an abrupt ending,
as on one fateful morning (the last day) General Rumley ascended
the gallery, and amid the silence of the Catacombs briefly
announced:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The late examination is cancelled; candidates will
attend again next Monday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The consternation that ensued is beyond description.&nbsp;
Jolliffe, who, I believe, had been measured for his uniform, did
not join for at least a year after, and poor old Plummy Ruthven,
who couldn&rsquo;t spell six <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>words correctly, abandoned all further
idea of the Army.&nbsp; He was sitting next me on the first day,
and I remember as if it were yesterday his whispered inquiry as
to the correct reply to a mathematical question: &ldquo;At what
hour between two and three are the hands of a clock opposite one
another?&rdquo;&nbsp; The reply, it is needless to add, had to be
&ldquo;worked out&rdquo; by figures, but thinking in the
excitement he was asking the time I hurriedly whispered,
&ldquo;Twenty minutes to one,&rdquo; and down it went on poor old
Plummy&rsquo;s paper.&nbsp; During the subsequent days his
papers, I fancy, were vastly improved, as he was a constant
visitor at the &ldquo;Hans Hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Aldershot of the sixties was a very different place to
what it is to-day.&nbsp; Three rows of huts&mdash;as the lines of
three regiments&mdash;constituted the North Camp, and about an
equal number and two blocks of permanent barracks represented the
South Camp.&nbsp; During the drill season everything else was
under canvas, and heaven help those who ever experienced the
watertight capacity of the regulation bell tent.&nbsp; I can well
remember one night, when the windows of heaven had been open for
days, a dripping figure in regimental great-coat and billycock
hat appearing in the mess tent with, &ldquo;The horse is
disthroyed, and I don&rsquo;t know what the Jasus to do,&rdquo;
and as he dripped at &ldquo;attention&rdquo; we realised it was
only the adjutant&rsquo;s Irish groom that had been washed out of
the temporary stable.</p>
<p>These wooden huts were peculiarly adapted for practical
joking.&nbsp; Within a week of my joining whilst contemplating
with admiration, previous to turning in, my brand new possessions
of portable furniture, I was astonished by a brick rattling down
the chimney.&nbsp; Barely had I dodged it when bang came another,
whilst not a sound disturbed the peaceful repose of the
camp.&nbsp; &ldquo;Great heavens,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;there
must be an earthquake,&rdquo; and rushing out <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>frantically
to give the alarm, I paused, and on second thoughts
returned.&nbsp; But in the few seconds that had elapsed there
must have been another violent shock, for everything in my room
was upside down&mdash;the bedding was capsized, my boots were
swimming in the tub, table-cloths, carpet, everything one huge
mass.&nbsp; It was then that it dawned upon me, &ldquo;this is
the finger of man,&rdquo; and I proceeded to adjust my
belongings.&nbsp; &ldquo;Anything up?&rdquo; now sounded through
the window, and the appearance of two brother ensigns explained
the rest.&nbsp; I was never molested afterwards.</p>
<p>Practical joking, however, occasionally assumed serious
proportions, and ended in courts-martial, as did the Crawley
case.&nbsp; It was on this occasion that Sir William Harcourt
first came prominently to notice by the brilliant oration he put
into his client&rsquo;s mouth: &ldquo;Give me back my
sword,&rdquo; was the dramatic phrase with which the old bully
ended his address.&nbsp; As if Crawley cared one rap what became
of his sword so long as the &pound;10,000 attached to his
commission as colonel of the Inniskillings was safe.</p>
<p>The Robertson court-martial, of which I was an eyewitness,
also created a stir in the long-ago sixties.&nbsp; The colonel of
the 4th Dragoon Guards was at the time one Bentinck, who, despite
his heirship to the Dukedom of Portland, was about as uncouth a
being as can well be conceived.&nbsp; As field officer of the
day, no matter how late, he never missed dismounting and walking
through the officers&rsquo; guard room without a word, as if he
were inspecting the married quarters, and it was this amiable
creature who eventually prosecuted, in conjunction with Adjutant
Harran, as harmless an individual as ever posed as a
sabreur.&nbsp; Captain Robertson was the son of a Highland laird,
and, if I remember rightly, had a very handsome wife.&nbsp; What
it was all about I have long since forgotten, though the cloud of
witnesses that radiated towards the Royal barracks is in many
ways impressed on my <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>memory.&nbsp; Captain Owen&mdash;an
important witness as he described himself&mdash;was an officer of
militia, and, more military than the military, he revelled in
things military.&nbsp; His staple conversation was military; a
sort of peakless cap his everyday head-dress; his very
dressing-gown was frogged like a light dragoon&rsquo;s frock
coat; for gloves he affected the buckskin class, and carried
glove-trees and pipeclay, at least whilst in Dublin.&nbsp; These
peculiarities were grafted on my memory by his having doubled up
for six weeks in my solitary room in Dublin.&nbsp; I had spoken
to him on one occasion, and in a weak moment invited him to
mess.&nbsp; How it all came about I have no recollection beyond
finding him located on me; having every meal at my expense, and
incurring a mess bill of over &pound;8, which I eventually had to
pay.&nbsp; &ldquo;D&mdash; it, old man,&rdquo; he often said,
&ldquo;this is like old times&rdquo; (when the annual training
was on, presumably); &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tear myself away from
the bugles.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he didn&rsquo;t, till peremptorily
requested to go.</p>
<p>Other witnesses of a more desirable type also swarmed for
weeks at our mess.&nbsp; Ginger Durant, who had never been out of
London since he left the 12th Lancers, was daily to be heard
bellowing &ldquo;To the rag, to the rag&rdquo; to the tune of
&ldquo;Dixey&rsquo;s Land,&rdquo; and General Dickson, a grand
old warrior (happily still as fresh as paint) who commanded the
Turkish contingent in the Crimea, champed his bit and cursed the
necessity that detained him in Dublin.</p>
<p>At Aldershot was a regiment that was supposed to have stormed
some place with ours a hundred years before, and in those days of
&ldquo;Regent&rsquo;s allowances&rdquo; and tolerably hard
drinking the occasion of again meeting in camp could not be
allowed to pass without various reciprocal hospitalities.&nbsp;
Their colonel was an old toper who never consumed less than
fifteen brandies-and-sodas after dinner, and well I recollect
hearing a mess waiter, as he helped him on with his <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>coat,
expressing the hope, in a whisper, that if a man came before him
in the morning for being drunk, he would not think it necessary
to give him forty-eight hours cells.&nbsp; But the interchange of
civilities was by no means over with the dinner, and a dozen of
our heroes insisting on seeing their guests home, deliberately
swam the Canal, and their comrades not to be outdone, insisted on
seeing our contingent back, till the innumerable duckings
restored sobriety and every one retired to his respective
hut.</p>
<p>Not having been at the storming in the Peninsula, I had
retired to bed early.</p>
<p>The purchase system, however personally delightful, was
undoubtedly a very cruel regulation.&nbsp; I myself within seven
years passed over five men who had joined when I was two years
old; but the injustice of it never struck me till on one occasion
the junior major of a regiment in the same brigade, who had got
his commission on the same day as I had, turned me out as
subaltern of a guard.&nbsp; But he had not obtained this luck
without risking &ldquo;Yellow Jack,&rdquo; for exchanging to a
West India regiment and jumping from bottom to top in every grade
by bribing the entire regiment was a thoroughly recognised
arrangement by our amiable authorities.&nbsp; D&rsquo;Arcy
Godolphin Osborne was an exponent of this brilliant bare-backed
(or bare-faced) vaulting, and despite being the brother of the
Duke of Leeds was not an ideal field officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Purchase&rdquo; literally killed poor &rsquo;Gus Anson,
brother of the Earl of Lichfield.&nbsp; With a constitution
shattered since Lucknow, where he won the V.C., night after night
found him arguing against its abolition in the House of Commons;
and the almost nightly intimations I sent him, at his request,
&ldquo;that we had enough for Baccarat&rdquo; did the rest, and I
eventually saw the best and bravest of men on his death-bed at
Dudley House.</p>
<h2><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE TOWER.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">About</span> this time all England was
ringing with what was known as the &ldquo;Trent affair&rdquo;;
10,000 troops had been ordered to Montreal, of which a
considerable portion were Guards, and so it devolved on certain
line battalions to garrison London, and we were ordered to the
Tower.</p>
<p>It was the regimental guest-night, and all the plate of which
the regiment was so proud decked the table in the dark wainscoted
room of the Mess House.&nbsp; In the middle of the table stood a
centre-piece displaying the soldiers in the uniforms of the days
of Marlborough, the Peninsular, and later on, when the hateful
Albert Shako did duty as the headgear of British infantry;
extending down each side were scrolls containing the names of
brave men who had fallen with their faces to the enemy at Quebec,
Quatre Bras, and the Redan, whilst flanking the massive trophy
were silver goblets varying in size&mdash;from those that held a
quart down to others of more modern dimensions, indicative of
presentations on promotion, marriage, or &ldquo;selling
out.&rdquo;&nbsp; It had, indeed, once been a custom for the last
joined ensign to drain the largest tankard on his first
appearance at mess; but that was in the days when four bottles
under a man&rsquo;s belt was deemed a reasonable amount, and
before the Regent&rsquo;s allowance enabled every one to consume
nightly a half-glass of port or sherry free of expense.</p>
<p>The Colonel, as may be supposed, was in great form, each of
his yarns exceeding in improbability <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>the one preceding it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, gentlemen,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;I remember my
father saying how at Quatre Bras the regiment found itself
confronted by the 88th French Infantry Corps, and he overheard
the right-hand man of his company saying, as he bit off the end
of his cartridge, &lsquo;Jasus, boys, here&rsquo;s a
case&mdash;here we are opposite the French Connaught
Rangers!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was saying, gentlemen,&rdquo; the Colonel&rsquo;s
voice was here heard declaring, &ldquo;that I shall never
forget&rdquo;&mdash;and then followed a tissue of fabrications
every one had frequently heard before, but which nobody but the
worthy old warrior for one moment believed.</p>
<p>Coffee and cigars had meanwhile made their welcome appearance,
and as guests began to think of home, and others settled down to
muff whist, the ante-room resumed the humdrum appearance so
familiar to every one who can speak from experience.</p>
<p>By the irony of fate, also, the regiment was furnishing the
guards on this special guest-night, a circumstance that claimed
more than one punter; not satisfied with which, the field
officer&rsquo;s &ldquo;roster&rdquo; had apparently joined issue
and requisitioned the old Major who, on these festive occasions
was always a sure hand at loo, and who at the identical moment
when he should have been &ldquo;taking the miss,&rdquo; was
probably bellowing out &ldquo;Grand Rounds,&rdquo; to some
distant guard in tones that belied his amiable genial
disposition.</p>
<p>George, on these occasions, was the recognised organiser, and
by herculean efforts had secured some half-dozen recruits to
commence loo as soon as old Hanmer returned.</p>
<p>Games of chance&mdash;even in the long-ago sixties&mdash;were
rarely indulged in in the ante-room, which was reserved
exclusively for solemn whist for nominal stakes, where the
players bottled up trumps, misdealt, and revoked, regardless of
all the canons of the game.</p>
<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>&ldquo;Damn it, sir!&rdquo; once exclaimed an irate
General at an inspection dinner to his trembling
partner&mdash;the assistant surgeon&mdash;&ldquo;Are you aware
that 3,000 shoeless men are tramping the streets of the Continent
for not leading trumps?&rdquo; to which the medico&mdash;who was
a Kerry man&mdash;replied respectfully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oi apalagoise, surr, most humbly; but oi disremembered
me abligation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obligation be d&mdash;, sir!&rdquo; replied the genial
old warrior as he lighted a fresh cheroot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Major&rsquo;s late,&rdquo; remarked George to a
confirmed loo player; &ldquo;let us go up to my room and get the
table ready.&nbsp; Come on,&rdquo; he continued to four or five
others, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll make a start anyhow; he can&rsquo;t be
long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officers&rsquo; quarters in the Tower can hardly be
described as spacious, and so by the addition of chairs from
other rooms; with the table lugged into the centre, and brandy
and sodas piled on the bed it was not long before some half-dozen
punters were securely wedged together and indulging in unlimited
loo for stakes that were not always nominal.</p>
<p>The Major, meanwhile, had joined the party and without
divesting himself of either cloak, shako, or sword, dashed into
the fray with considerably greater zeal than he had displayed
when going the rounds.&nbsp; Not that he was any feather-bed
soldier; on the contrary, he had borne his full share of the
trenches, and then often found himself told off to march to
Balaclava with a fatigue party, and eventually to enjoy a few
hours&rsquo; sleep in wet clothes on wet ground, whilst blankets
and boots were rotting within six miles, and all because brave
men were at the front, and old women were at the back of that
rickety machine called the War Office.</p>
<p>Billy Hanmer, amid the ordinary walks of life, was of a chilly
temperament; the thermometer in his quarters was never permitted
to register less than <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>65 degrees; he wore flannels all the
year round, which in winter were duplicated, even to his socks;
when he became excited&mdash;which never occurred except at loo,
or when suddenly called upon to drill the battalion&mdash;the
three hairs that were usually pasted across his martial skull
rose like the crest of a cockatoo, and he was apt to give vent to
expressions seldom or never heard at a bishop&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Swearing in those long-ago days was considered a necessary
adjunct to military efficiency, as any one who was under
Pennefather when he commanded at Aldershot can testify, and so it
was that the Major was now swearing like a trooper.&nbsp; As a
fact, he had just been &ldquo;loo-ed,&rdquo; and was counting
some forty sovereigns into the pool, and every sovereign was
accompanied by an oath as unique as it was unavailing.</p>
<p>George Hay, sportsman though he was, was also a bad loser, but
this evening, in his capacity as host the Fates had happily
protected him.&nbsp; The grilled bones that appeared at 2 a.m.,
and the inordinate amount of brandy and soda that had been
consumed, were all put down to him; but the hundred he had won
left ample margin for the hospitality, and towards five our hero
fell into a profound and refreshing sleep, periodically enlivened
by sweet visions of huge pools that he persistently raked in,
whilst Billy Hanmer, divested of cloak, sword, and shako, was
swearing till the old rafters rattled.</p>
<p>In those days the club most affected by subalterns was the
&ldquo;Raleigh,&rdquo; a charming night-house, approached by a
tunnel, whose portals opened at dusk and closed reputedly at four
a.m., or whenever its members vacated it.&nbsp; And the comfort
of that long, delightful single room!&nbsp; Ranged round its
entirety were fauteuils, suitable alike for forty winks, or
brandy and soda, or the only eatables procurable&mdash;bacon on
toast sandwiches with a dash of biting sauce.&nbsp; Here might be
seen the best men in London percolating <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>through at
every moment, and exchanging badinage as brilliant as probably it
was naughty&mdash;poor old George Lawrence of &ldquo;Sword and
Gown&rdquo; fame, and Piggy Lawrence, killed not long after in a
regimental steeplechase; Fred Granville, who assisted at a once
celebrated elopement by waiting at one door of an Oxford Street
shop for the beautiful <i>fianc&eacute;e</i> of a wealthy
landowner whose brougham had deposited her at another; Freddy
Cooper, the best four-in-hand whip of the day; the wicked Marquis
who ran through a fortune almost before he was of age; and young
Wyndham, another Croesus of the duck-and-drake type; Sir Henry de
Hoghton of the red tie and velvet suit who thought he could play
ecart&eacute;; and King-Harman, then a sinner, but eventually a
saint, who died in the sanctity of respectability.&nbsp; These,
and a hundred others, all, alas gone to the inevitable dustbin,
and yet the old building exists, <i>externally</i> apparently the
same&mdash;the haunt of aspiring youths seeking a club with a
past, respectable and cautious to the highest degree, where
cheques are not cashed over &pound;5, and the doors close at one
a.m. to the tick.</p>
<p>But even in these long-ago days, the membership increased to
such an extent that elbow-room had to be sought, and so Sally
Sutherland&rsquo;s, a high-class night-house that abutted on the
premises, was eventually taken in, and became the card room of
the old Raleigh.&nbsp; To see this room in its glory it was
necessary to enter it during the Derby week, where, as far as the
eye could reach (and farther), one dense mass of human faces
watched the proceedings at the card table, and fought and hustled
to pass fivers and tenners and fifties towards building up the
mountain of bank notes that flanked either side of the table.</p>
<p>Seated composedly were the two champions with their bankers
alongside them, then a fringe ten deep of pasty-faced cornets and
rubicund old sinners with sheaves of bank notes in their hands,
while beyond <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>were the &ldquo;fielders&rdquo;&mdash;landsharks who
never played&mdash;eagerly watching every turn of the cards to
take advantage of any bet that appeared slightly in their
favour.&nbsp; &ldquo;Chalky&rdquo; White&mdash;the master of the
Essex as he was ironically called&mdash;because he affected horsy
overalls, and was once seen on a screw at the Boat Race; Captain
Mulroony, an Irish buckeen who joined the &ldquo;North
Corks&rdquo; to be eligible for &ldquo;the cloob&rdquo;;
&ldquo;the Rapparee,&rdquo; another warrior with a brogue of a
pronounced order, all ready to plunge on a reasonable certainty
and retail their experiences later on, on their return to
Dublin.&nbsp; Needless to add, we youngsters had put down our
names <i>en bloc</i> for membership as soon as we had settled
down at the Tower, and on the memorable night to which we refer
were in great force in the long room.&nbsp; George Hay, one of
our lieutenants who was being entertained by a venerable member,
was wrapped in contemplation as he watched a decrepit old
gentleman sipping a gin sling.&nbsp; &ldquo;That
man&rdquo;&mdash;his cicerone was telling him&mdash;&ldquo;fought
the last duel in England; look at him now, about eighty if
he&rsquo;s a day, and barely able to crawl down here, and yet
fifty years ago he had a drunken brawl with his best friend at
Crockford&rsquo;s, and shot him dead before breakfast at the back
of Ham House.&nbsp; Wait till the play begins and you&rsquo;ll
see him &lsquo;fielding&rsquo;; he never plays, but if he sees a
chance, no matter how slightly in his favour, he still pulls out
a crumpled fiver and invites you to cover it.&nbsp; He only bets
&lsquo;ready,&rsquo; and would probably &lsquo;call you
out&rsquo; if you suggested &lsquo;booking&rsquo; it.&nbsp; That
man in the blue shirt is the Duke of Hamilton; he only turns up
in the Derby week, and has probably just arrived by special
train.&nbsp; We call him &lsquo;the butcher,&rsquo; because of
his shirt and his punching proclivities.&nbsp; He plunges, too;
wait a bit till the Leviathans turn up.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll see
some sport yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do, George?&rdquo; inquired <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>a youngster;
&ldquo;why not have a look in at Kate Hamilton&rsquo;s?&nbsp;
This is all d&mdash; rot, and I&rsquo;ve put my name down for 2
a.m.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Putting one&rsquo;s name down, it may be explained, was a
necessary formality indicating at what hour an officer intended
to return when the wicket at the Tower was opened and closed, and
punctuality was a necessity of the greatest moment.</p>
<p>On one occasion, indeed when &ldquo;Payther&rdquo; Madden was
on sentry, the wife of an officer who gave herself considerable
airs having arrived five minutes late was challenged from inside
by &ldquo;Who goes there?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the
Major&rsquo;s lady,&rdquo; was the haughty response.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Divil a bit do I care if ye were the Major&rsquo;s
wife!&rdquo; yelled Payther from inside; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll not
get in till the wicket is opened agin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the approaches to the Tower in those days were not the
broad and well-lighted avenues such as the Eastcheap of to-day;
tortuous alleys and dingy, narrow streets had to be traversed,
and the garrotter was very much in evidence.&nbsp; Officers
returning late carried knuckle-dusters and short blades in their
right-hand overcoat pockets, ready to job any footpad who
attempted to seize them from behind.&nbsp; Men seldom returned
but in parties of twos or threes, and so it was that the
Major&rsquo;s &ldquo;lady&rdquo; found herself constrained to hug
the walls of the grim old fortress during the early hours of that
memorable night in the long-ago sixties.</p>
<p>It was the night after the big race, when Caractacus was
responsible for much that followed, that the crowd at the Raleigh
was phenomenal, and champagne was being consumed in tumblers from
the entrance hall to the card room.&nbsp; Thousands had changed
hands within the past dozen hours, and old Jimmy Jopp with his
chocolate wig over his left eye was scrambling sovereigns from
the doorstep amongst the fair guests of our country who thronged
the boulevard.&nbsp; The card room <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>had not as yet entered on its usual
function, the window was indeed open in an endeavour to dilute
the stifling atmosphere, and a corpulent old lady with a Flemish
accent was half-way in the sacred precincts through the combined
efforts of a bevy of fair compatriots on the pavement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curse these races,&rdquo; ejaculated Biscoe,
&ldquo;where have the plungers got to?&nbsp; Nearly one
o&rsquo;clock by G&mdash;, and a pile to be got home before
daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This Biscoe was not a favourite in the club; of a hectoring
disposition he added to his unpopularity by the pursuit of sharp
practices.&nbsp; If he won he invariably found an excuse to
retire with his gains, and if he lost he became cantankerous and
offensive in his remarks.&nbsp; Some there were, indeed, who went
so far as hinting that he was not above unfair dealings.&nbsp; He
was partial to shuffling the cards with their faces towards him
and placing a king at the bottom of the pack.&nbsp; This he
explained was mere force of habit, and when remonstrated
with&mdash;as he often had been&mdash;added that he was
superstitious and that one of his superstitions took this
form.&nbsp; No actual act of foul play had ever been brought home
to him; he was nevertheless under suspicion, and being otherwise
unpopular, his eccentricities assumed a graver form when balanced
by hostile critics.</p>
<p>Cheating in those long-ago days was happily a rare occurrence;
a man about town might beggar his parents, or drive his wife into
the workhouse, and still hold up his head as a man of honour if
he met his card debts on the nail; but &ldquo;sharping&rdquo; was
practically unknown till some years later, when a scandal that
thrilled Europe and involved a deep erasure in the Army List was
enacted at Nice.</p>
<p>The Raleigh, meanwhile, was gradually simmering down; choice
spirits had started for Cremorne or Mott&rsquo;s; the more
soberly amused had wended their steps towards Evans&rsquo;s, and
the residue might have <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>been classed as either punters or
puntees&mdash;if such base coin will bear alloy.</p>
<p>Seated in the card room, Biscoe still smoked in his solitude;
before him was a gilt-bound volume such as betting men affect,
and its contemplation apparently did not afford unalloyed
pleasure.&nbsp; &ldquo;Egad,&rdquo; he muttered,
&ldquo;&pound;4,000, more or less, and not a hundred to meet it
with; to-night it&rsquo;s neck or nothing, and if nobody bleeds I
shall be unable to face the music on Monday.&nbsp; Ah, De
Hoghton,&rdquo; he exclaimed, barely looking up as an apparition
in velvet and red tie appeared, &ldquo;been at Epsom?&nbsp;
No?&nbsp; Perhaps you were wise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paddy was too clever to suggest a game, knowing as he did the
eccentric baronet&rsquo;s peculiarities.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never
mind,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;better luck to-morrow,
perhaps.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m half asleep.&nbsp; Good-night,&rdquo;
and he rose as if about to depart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the hurry?&rdquo; inquired the new
arrival.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you want to keep awake I&rsquo;ll play
you half a dozen games of ecart&eacute;, but only for small
stakes, mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Want indeed!&nbsp; It was what Biscoe had wanted for hours,
and as to the stakes, did he not know from delightful experience
that if they began at &pound;5 it would not be long before the
game was for hundreds, and that his adversary&rsquo;s rent roll
might be counted in thousands?</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Sir Henry,&rdquo; replied Biscoe, &ldquo;name
your own stakes.&nbsp; No fear of making them too low.&nbsp; I
feel in bad form to-night, and your science will be altogether
too much for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say a pony then,&rdquo; continued the baronet, and they
cut for deal.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the room began gradually to fill, and as the
unmistakable flutter of crisp notes&mdash;for which no
resemblance has ever been discovered&mdash;made itself heard in
the long room, George Hay and a troop of others sauntered
negligently into the room.</p>
<p><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>&ldquo;Sit beside me, Colonel,&rdquo; De Hoghton
requested a grizzly, rubicund warrior, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be
able to advise me when they make a pool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, Rapparee, I want you,&rdquo; exclaimed
Biscoe.&nbsp; &ldquo;We must show these English boys how we play
at Stephen&rsquo;s Green,&rdquo; and a fire-eating pronounced
Hibernian took post alongside his compatriot.</p>
<p>For a considerable time the luck appeared to fluctuate, and if
hundreds were passed across the table on one game, they returned
more or less intact at the subsequent encounter.&nbsp; Play was
now in real earnest, and stakes were hazarded that were simply
appalling.&nbsp; Biscoe, too, appeared to be in for a run of
luck, and the excited whisperings between him and the Rapparee
left little room for doubt that he contemplated a retreat on the
first defeat.</p>
<p>His winnings, indeed, were considerable, and a smile pervaded
his hitherto scowling face as he contemplated the Monday&rsquo;s
settling with equanimity.&nbsp; Again the bank was declared, and
a pile of notes larger than any of its predecessors lumbered each
side of the table; eyes, apparently, had no other vocation than
to watch their respective champion&rsquo;s hands; the ticking of
the clock on the mantelpiece became a nuisance, and the
grasshopper literally became a burden; the silence of the
Catacombs pervaded the entire assembly, when a voice, shrill and
excited, was heard: &ldquo;Do that again, Mr. Biscoe, and
I&rsquo;ll expose you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the Colonel, who leaning across the table bore down
Biscoe&rsquo;s hands with a strong right arm as he was in the act
of shuffling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I to understand by this?&rdquo; inquired Biscoe
looking towards the Rapparee.&nbsp; &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s by way
of an insult you&rsquo;ve met the right boy to resent it.&nbsp;
Hands off, sir!&rdquo; he shouted, as shaking off the
Colonel&rsquo;s hand, he hurled the pack of cards in his
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold, hold, gentlemen, for God&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo;
implored <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>De Hoghton, as a dozen men interposed between the
belligerents.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some explanation is surely forthcoming
that may avoid a scandal.&nbsp; Colonel, tell those gentlemen
what you saw, and let them decide on the merits before it gets
into the papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I saw I am prepared to prove,&rdquo; replied the
Colonel, excitedly; &ldquo;but even that sinks into
insignificance, as far as I am personally concerned, in face of
the man&rsquo;s assault.&nbsp; Meanwhile, pick up these cards,
count them carefully, and if you don&rsquo;t find five kings in
the pack I&rsquo;ll apologise to Mr. Biscoe, and take his assault
like a coward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then a scramble on the floor began, which was followed by
breathless silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Count them, please,&rdquo; requested the Colonel, and
sure enough 33 was the result.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now turn the faces towards you, sir,&rdquo; continued
the Colonel; &ldquo;and extract the kings.&rdquo;&nbsp; And lo!
before a dumbfounded crowd, two kings of hearts were
displayed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This, gentlemen, is my accusation.&nbsp; I charge Mr.
Biscoe with being a card-sharper and a cheat.&nbsp; To-morrow
I&rsquo;ll lay my charge before the Committee; meanwhile, I
retire and will ask you, Hay, to act as my
representative.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rapparee meanwhile had been in whispered conversation with
his friend, and on the Colonel&rsquo;s departure, addressed
himself to Hay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oi presume, surr, your principal will meet my man
unless he&rsquo;s a coward, and we shall be pleased to let him
fix his own day, either before or afther his complaint to the
Committee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is hardly the time, sir, to enter into such
arrangements,&rdquo; replied Hay, courteously; &ldquo;but I vouch
for Colonel George doing what is right and honourable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But one of the younger members seemed inclined to treat the
matter as a joke, and turning towards <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>the Rapparee, remarked, &ldquo;But,
surely, sir, you must see that if it&rsquo;s a duel you are
hinting at, it would hardly be fair considering that Colonel
George is considerably stouter than Mr. Biscoe.&nbsp; May we
assume, sir, that you won&rsquo;t object to a chalk mark down
each side of the Colonel&rsquo;s waistcoat, and a hit outside not
to count?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surr!&rdquo; scowled the Rapparee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; pleaded Hay; &ldquo;this is not a joking
matter, the honour of the Club and of every member who was
present is at stake till the affair is cleared up.&nbsp; I appeal
to you, gentlemen, one and all, to retire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning to the Rapparee, and raising his hat, he continued:
&ldquo;My name, sir, is Lieutenant Hay, and I&rsquo;m stationed
at the Tower.&rdquo;</p>

25</span>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MOTT&rsquo;S AND CREMORNE.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">London</span> in the sixties possessed no
music-halls as at present except the London Pavilion and a
transpontine establishment unknown to the West End.&nbsp; This
former had not long previously been transformed from a swimming
bath into an undertaker&rsquo;s shed, which in its turn gave
place to the dingy hall which eventually made the fortune of a
waiter from Scott&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But such excitement (!) hardly
met the requirements of progressive civilisation, which found an
outlet in the Argyll, Cremorne, the Caf&eacute; Riche, Sally
Sutherland&rsquo;s, Kate Hamilton&rsquo;s, Rose Young&rsquo;s,
and Mott&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It seems but yesterday that one was
sipping champagne at Boxall&rsquo;s stall in the Caf&eacute;
Riche (now a flower shop adjoining the Criterion) waiting for
young Broome the pugilist, who was to pilot one in safety to
&ldquo;the big fight between King and Heenan.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
those halcyon days caf&eacute;s remained open all night, and
three a.m. was the hour appointed for our start for London
Bridge.&nbsp; What splendid aid was then given legitimate sport
by the authorities, as driving through rows of police across
London Bridge one reached the terminus in comfort by simply
displaying one&rsquo;s ticket.&nbsp; With a pork pie in one
pocket, and a handkerchief in another, one&rsquo;s peace of mind
was delightful, and hands in every pocket&mdash;aye, and knives
to cut one out if necessary&mdash;were accepted only as a portion
of a novel and delightful excitement.</p>
<p><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>Pitching the ring again in one field and being warned
off by the Kent constabulary, how invigorating the tramp through
ploughed fields, till again we found a spot&mdash;this time
undisturbed&mdash;in the muddy plains of Sussex.&nbsp; Wisps of
straw provided for the more favoured by the attention of their
punching cicerones, the biting of King&rsquo;s ear to bring him
to &ldquo;time,&rdquo; the two giants half blind, swinging their
arms mechanically, the accidental blow that felled the brave
Heenan, and the shameful verdict that denied him the victory ten
minutes previously, the return to the &ldquo;Bricklayers&rsquo;
Arms&rdquo;&mdash;how vivid it all seems!&nbsp; And yet
principals, seconds, lookers-on, where are they?</p>
<p>The Caf&eacute; Riche of the long-ago sixties was perhaps the
most successful and best regulated of the haunts of vanished
London.&nbsp; Slack to an extreme till about 11 p.m., the huge
mass of humanity as it poured out of the Argyll made straight for
it.&nbsp; As one traversed the almost impassable Windmill Street
along the narrow path kept by a bevy of police, all thoughts
turned towards the Caf&eacute; Riche, where the best of suppers,
oysters, and champagne prepared one for the more arduous
exertions of Cremorne or Mott&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Cremorne in those
days was a delightful resort, with an excellent band, and
frequented by the most exalted of men and the most beautiful of
women.&nbsp; Here might be seen nightly during his stay in London
a late ruling monarch (then Crown Prince) whose moustache the
ladies insisted on twisting; here, too, occasionally big rows
took place, affairs that originated in some trifle, such as the
irritation of an excitable blood on seeing a harmless shop-boy
dancing in the ring.&nbsp; King-Harman probably was the principal
originator of these encounters.&nbsp; Naturally of an amiable but
plethoric disposition, a sight such as the above was like a red
rag to a bull, and in no time the fight became universal and
furious.&nbsp; Gas was <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>turned off, the ringleaders bolted,
pursued by police.&nbsp; A run as far as Chelsea Hospital with a
&ldquo;bobby&rdquo; in full cry was by no means an uncommon
occurrence.</p>
<p>On the occasions when exalted foreigners like Prince Humbert
were going, the ground in a way had to be salted.&nbsp;
Intimation was privately conveyed to certain well-known
roysterers at Long&rsquo;s, the Raleigh, and elsewhere, that an
exalted personage asked them to abstain from rows; a puncher and
two or three bloods were told off to accompany, and a special
envoy was instructed to warn Johnny Baum (the lessee) not to be
aware of the angel he was harbouring and to resist the temptation
of any gush and &ldquo;dutiful&rdquo; toadyism; and so on the
eventful night Humbert lolled unrecognised through the revelling
crowds, whilst ghastly veterans in harlotry twitted him on his
huge moustache and thrust cards into his fist as tokens of
British hospitality.</p>
<p>Mott&rsquo;s, too, was a unique institution, select it might
almost be termed, considering the precautions that were taken
regarding admittance.&nbsp; Every man who entered was known by
name or sight.&nbsp; A man of good birth or position, no matter
how great a rou&eacute;, was admitted as it were by right, whilst
parvenus, however wealthy, were turned empty away.&nbsp; It was
told indeed that on one occasion, being importuned for admission
by a wealthy hatter, old Freer, having been requested by the
indignant shop-boy to take his card, had replied, &ldquo;Not
necessary, sir.&nbsp; Not necessary.&nbsp; I have your name in my
hat.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so the line that divided the classes in the
sixties was religiously respected.&nbsp; In those benighted days
tradesmen sent in their bills apologetically, and if a tailor
began to importune, a fresh order met the case.&nbsp; Flats were
unbuilt, and people did not hear what was going on all day and
all night at their next door neighbour&rsquo;s; inferiors said
&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Right you are&rdquo; was a <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>phrase
uncoined; if you dined at Simpson&rsquo;s or Limmer&rsquo;s you
were served on silver, and no waiter ventured to ask you who won
the 3.45 race; club waiters literally stalked one as they
approached with a dish, and the caravanserais that now dominate
the entire length of Piccadilly had not pulled down club averages
nor reduced the prestige that attached to club membership.&nbsp;
The great gulf was fixed as immovably as between Dives and
Lazarus when Abraham was the umpire, and things probably found
their level as well as in these advanced days, when money is
everything, and &pound;20,000 judiciously applied will ensure a
baronetcy.</p>
<p>The ladies who frequented Mott&rsquo;s, moreover, were not the
tawdry make-believes that haunt the modern &ldquo;Palaces,&rdquo;
but actresses of note, who, if not Magdalens, sympathised with
them; girls of education and refinement who had succumbed to the
blandishments of youthful lordlings; fair women here and there
who had not yet developed into peeresses and progenitors of
future legislators.&nbsp; Among them were &ldquo;Skittles,&rdquo;
celebrated for her ponies, and Sweet Nelly Fowler, the undisputed
Queen of Beauty in those long-ago days.&nbsp; This beautiful girl
had a natural perfume, so delicate, so universally admitted, that
love-sick swains paid large sums for the privilege of having
their handkerchiefs placed under the Goddess&rsquo;s pillow, and
sweet Nelly pervaded&mdash;in the spirit, if not in the
flesh&mdash;half the clubs and drawing-rooms of London.</p>
<p>This remnant of old-fashioned homage was by no means unusual,
and at fancy bazaars it was an almost invariable custom to secure
the services of the belle of the hour to sell strawberries at 2s.
6d. apiece, which the fair vendor placed to her lip and then
pushed between the swain&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Years later a matronly
creature, forgetting that her charms had long since vanished,
essayed to fill the coffers of a charity bazaar by similar <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>blandishments, and as one looked at the hollow cheeks
and discoloured tusks one was fain to wonder what the effect of
the &ldquo;treatment&rdquo; would be on the most robust
constitution.</p>
<p>Situated in an unpretentious house in Foley Street, the
ballroom at Mott&rsquo;s (as it appeared in the sixties) was a
spacious octagon with a glass dome.&nbsp; At the side, approached
by a few steps, was the supper room, where between 2 and 3 a.m.
cold fowl and ham and champagne were discussed, the fiddlers
descending from their loft, and revelry fast and furious took the
place of the valse.</p>
<p>Not many years ago, impelled by an irresistible impulse, I
visited the hall of dazzling light; a greasy drab opened the
street door, and conducted me into a dingy apartment, which she
assured me was the old haunt.&nbsp; Sure enough, there stood the
dilapidated orchestra perch, and, yet a little way off, the steps
that led to the supper room; and whilst I was contemplating them
with something very like a lump in my throat, a squeaky voice
addressed me, and I beheld a decrepit old man&mdash;all that was
left of poor old Freer&mdash;whom memory associated with an
expanse of white waistcoat, essaying hints such as, &ldquo;Now,
then, lady&rsquo;s chain,&rdquo; or hob-nobbing with some beauty,
or remonstrating, &ldquo;Really, my lord, these practical jokes
cannot be permitted.&rdquo;&nbsp; This temple of the past may
still be seen with all the windows smashed and on the eve of
demolition.</p>
<p>Lord Hastings in those far-off days was the chief culprit in
every devilry.&nbsp; Beloved by police and publican, he occupied
a privileged position; nothing vicious characterised his jokes,
and he had but one enemy&mdash;himself.&nbsp; His advent at a
ratting match or a badger drawing was a signal to every loafer
that the hour of his thirst was ended, and that henceforth
&ldquo;the Markis was in the chair.&rdquo;&nbsp; Six cases of
champagne invariably formed the first order, and as old <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>Jimmy Shaw
shouted, &ldquo;&rsquo;Ere, more glasses there, and dust a chair
for &rsquo;is Lordship,&rdquo; the four ale bar closed in, as it
were, and duke and dustman hobnobbed and clinked glasses with a
deferential familiarity unknown in these levelling days.</p>
<p>Lord Hastings selected his companions on facial and other
merits, and no meeker, more guileless-looking youths existed than
Bobby Shafto and Freddy Granville.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bobby,&rdquo;
said the Marquis, on one occasion, when he had arranged a
surprise at Mott&rsquo;s, &ldquo;we must go round to Jimmy
Shaw&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve to pick up a parcel there, and,
look here, old man, you must smuggle it in somehow; old Freer
always looks carefully at me, but he&rsquo;ll never suspect you;
you must carry it under your cape, and when we get inside mind,
don&rsquo;t go down to the supper room.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll run down
for a second, and then join you; you know the spot I showed you
near the meter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arriving in Windmill Street, no time was lost in
preliminaries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it all right, Jimmy?&rdquo; inquired the Marquis,
and in reply a cadaverous individual dressed like a gamekeeper
respectfully approached his lordship.&nbsp; This was the
professional rat-catcher, who traversed the main drains half the
day, and supplied the various sporting haunts with thousands of
rats nightly.</p>
<p>If a dog was backed to kill one thousand rats in a specified
time the supply never failed to be equal to the demand, despite
the hundreds that were pitted nightly against ferrets, or
produced at so much a dozen for young bloods to try their dogs
on.</p>
<p>To see this rat-catcher plunge his hand into a sack full of
huge and ferocious sewer rats and extracting them one by one by
the tail count the requisite amount into the pit was a sight
beyond description, as legislators, cabinet ministers, peers, and
army men threw sovereigns at him in payment of the sport
supplied.</p>
<p><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>Carrying a sack in his hand this individual respectfully
replied: &ldquo;All right, my lud, two hundred as varmint a lot
as iver I clapped eyes on.&nbsp; Thanks, your lordship, good luck
to yer,&rdquo; and he pocketed his fee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But are they tied all right?&rdquo; inquired Bobby, as
the parcel was presented to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, sir?&nbsp; Why, you&rsquo;ve only to slip this
string like, and there you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know where I should be,&rdquo; suggested Bobby;
&ldquo;but I mean now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be d&mdash;d if
I&rsquo;ll put them under my cloak for a thousand till you make a
regular knot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there you are, sir,&rdquo; replied the expert
with a pitying smile, as he performed the requisite function.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re all right, Bobby,&rdquo; added the
Marquis.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come on, we must catch them at
supper.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got a knife, come on,&rdquo; and
directing the hansom to Foley Street, the conspirators proceeded
on their mission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very quiet!&rdquo; remarked the Marquis, as Freer
received them at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supper, my lord, supper; and, beg pardon, my lord, no
larks to-night, please; we&rsquo;ve a rare lot here to-night, my
lord; Lord Londesboro&rsquo; is here with Miss Fowler and no end
of toffs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Freer, what are you talking about?&nbsp; Look at
me,&rdquo; and he displayed his white waistcoat, &ldquo;and Mr.
Shafto here, he doesn&rsquo;t know London or your infernal
place.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m showing him the rounds, Freer; we
shan&rsquo;t stay long,&rdquo; and, preceded by the unsuspecting
old sinner, the pair proceeded as arranged.</p>
<p>Sitting in the deserted room, Bobby scanned the empty
orchestra loft, whilst shouts intermingled with the popping of
corks arose from the supper room beyond, so shifting his position
to nearer proximity to the meter, he awaited the return of his
companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, old man, they&rsquo;ll be up in ten minutes,
but don&rsquo;t budge till the fiddles strike up; here&rsquo;s
the <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>knife,
blade open; don&rsquo;t cut till I say &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; and
bolt like h&mdash; once the gas is out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The requisite wait was not of long duration.&nbsp; First came
old Freer, as, casting a sheep&rsquo;s eye at the Marquis, he
contemplated the orchestra; next, producing a watch, he shouted,
&ldquo;time, gentlemen,&rdquo; and half a dozen seedy
instrumentalists ascended the stairs.&nbsp; The pianist, it was
evident, was in his cups, but no notice was taken of
this&mdash;it being admitted that he played better when drunk
than when sober, and had even been known to supply impromptu
variations and improvements to the &ldquo;Mabel Valse&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Blue Danube&rdquo; when under the exhilarating influence
of Freer&rsquo;s brut champagne.&nbsp; Then followed a bevy of
fair women&mdash;Nelly Fowler and her worshipful lord;
&ldquo;Shoes,&rdquo; who eventually became Lady W&mdash;; Baby
Jordan, Nelly Clifford, the innocent cause of dynastic ructions
twelve months later at the Curragh&mdash;closely followed by Fred
Granville, Lyttleton, Chuckles, John Delapont, of the 11th, and a
mob of flushed men, and as the fiddles began to twang, and the
dancers took up positions, the Marquis thought fit to add a word
in season.&nbsp; &ldquo;Talk away, old man, as if it was
something private, or some one will be coming up and spoiling the
game; go on, man; now then, look out, is the knife all
ready?&nbsp; Shake &rsquo;em well out, old man, they can&rsquo;t
hurt you; look out, are you ready?&nbsp; Now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To describe what followed is impossible.&nbsp; Two hundred men
and women, and two hundred sewer rats, compressed within the
compass of forty feet by thirty, and in a darkness as profound as
was ever experienced in Egypt.</p>
<p>Bobby and Hastings meanwhile were driving towards Cremorne
with the complacency of men who had done their duty.</p>
<p>Cremorne on a Derby night baffles description; progress round
the dancing platform was almost <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>impossible.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Hermit&rsquo;s Cave&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Fairy
Bower&rdquo; were filled to repletion, and to pass the private
boxes was to run the gauntlet of a quartern loaf or a dish of
cutlets at one&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; Fun fast and furious reigned
supreme, during which the smaller fry of shop-boys and hired
dancers pirouetted within the ring with their various
partners.&nbsp; But as time advanced, and the wine circulated,
the advent of detachments of roysterers bespoke a not-distant
row.&nbsp; A Derby night without a row was, in those days, an
impossibility, and the night that our contingent started from the
Raleigh was no exception to the rule.</p>
<p>No man in his senses brought a watch, and if his coat was torn
and his hat smashed, what matter?&nbsp; And if he lost the few
shillings provided to meet cab fare and incidental expenses the
loss was not a serious one, always supposing a cab was to be
found, and one was not in the clutches of the law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s King-Harman,&rdquo; remarked Hastings,
&ldquo;let us stick near him; there&rsquo;s bound to be a row
before morning, and we may as well be together.&nbsp; Can you
run, Bobby?&nbsp; Not with that cape, though; you&rsquo;ll have
to chuck that; but what does it matter, it&rsquo;s done its duty,
and it&rsquo;s unworthy of a less honourable
distinction?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Bobby.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
fancy wearing it after those infernal rats.&nbsp; But why should
there be a row?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A row, man,&rdquo; replied his mentor, &ldquo;of course
there&rsquo;ll be a row; what did we come here for but a
row?&nbsp; What did King-Harman come here for, do you suppose,
but a row?&nbsp; And look here, when they turn the gas
out&mdash;as they always do&mdash;run like blazes; you&rsquo;re
not safe till you get to Chelsea Hospital, and don&rsquo;t run
into the arms of a policeman; they sometimes stop chaps running,
on spec.,&rdquo; and with these words of wisdom they mingled with
the crowd.</p>
<p>The expected d&eacute;nouement was not long in coming, <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>and in a
second, and without apparent warning, sticks were crashing down
on top hats, tumblers flying in every direction, and fists coming
in contact with anything or anybody whose proximity seemed to
suggest it.</p>
<p>The fiddlers had meanwhile made a hasty retreat, the gas was
put out, and with the exception here and there of an illumination
(a dip steeped in oil), the free fight continued till a bevy of
police appeared upon the scene.</p>
<p><i>Sauve qui peut</i> was then the word, and helter skelter,
old and young, Jew and Gentile, soiled doves and hereditary
legislators dashed like the proverbial herd of swine towards the
gates.&nbsp; Often did this stampede continue for a mile, till
straggling cabs, on their way to their stables, picked up the
stragglers, and landed them in less disturbed districts.&nbsp;
But the night was by no means over, not certainly the Derby night
for roysterers like Lord Hastings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a rasher of bacon, Bobby,&rdquo; he
explained, as they descended in Piccadilly Circus.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s barely five o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; and they
entered an unpretentious coffee-house in rear of the colonnade,
much frequented by roysterers and market gardeners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Qui hi</i>;&rdquo; shouted a voice as they took
their seats in an uncomfortable pew, and old Jim Stewart, of the
93rd, and a companion hailed them from behind a mountain of eggs
and bacon.</p>
<p>But their adventures were not to end with this wholesome
repast, as, coming out, they espied an empty cart, into which
they all proceeded to climb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, master,&rdquo; shouted the owner, disturbed at his
meal, &ldquo;that be moine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not it, man,&rdquo; yelled Hastings; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
mine; jump in,&rdquo; and, without a murmur, the worthy man
obeyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where to, master?&rdquo; was the next inquiry.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I be going for a load of gravel to Scotland
Yard.&rdquo;&nbsp; And <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>within half an hour four bucks with
white ties were shovelling in gravel as if their lives depended
on it.</p>
<p>Scotland Yard in those days was a public gravel-pit, and its
name did not convey the painful suggestions of after years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where now, master?&rdquo; inquired the yokel again, and
St. John&rsquo;s Wood was the order.</p>
<p>Here, before a palatial mansion, the cart pulled up, and the
load was shot on to the steps.&nbsp; Johnny MacNair, the
handsomest man in the Highland Brigade, who was too
&ldquo;exhausted&rdquo; to be moved, was then pushed into the
hall, and the cort&egrave;ge again departed.</p>
<p>To describe further would be a physical impossibility.&nbsp;
Exhausted nature, bad wine, possibly the bacon and eggs, all
combined to make memory a blank.&nbsp; Suffice that the house was
the private residence of a corpulent ratepayer and respected
member of St. Stephen&rsquo;s Church, who appeared in the
&ldquo;Court Directory&rdquo; as Mrs. Hamilton.</p>
<p>The final episode was the appearance of Johnny MacNair at
Rawling&rsquo;s Hotel at three in the afternoon very irate, and
only appeased on being assured that the episode was a blank to
others beside himself.</p>
<p>People may say how scandalous all this reads, and how thankful
we ought to be to be living in these decorous twentieth century
days!&nbsp; But reflect, virtuous reader.&nbsp; The sixties, if
apparently bad, were not so bad as the days of the Georges, which
again compare favourably with the golden days when Charles (of
blessed memory) was King.&nbsp; Vigilance societies did not then
exist as now, and fifty institutions with their secretaries and
staff had not to be supported by seekers after morality.&nbsp;
London was not even blessed with a County Council, and John Burns
probably could have robbed a birds&rsquo; nest as deftly as the
veriest scapegrace in those long-ago roystering days.</p>
<p><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>Place a
file of the Divorce Court proceedings in the scales, add the
scandals that occasionally get into print, and, having adjusted
them carefully, decide honestly whether the balance is much
against the London of the long-ago sixties.</p>
<h2><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">KATE HAMILTON&mdash;AND LEICESTER
SQUARE.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> entrance to Kate
Hamilton&rsquo;s may best be located as the spot on which
Appenrodt&rsquo;s German sausage shop now stands, although the
premises extended right through to Leicester Square.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go yet, dear,&rdquo; appealed a sweet siren
as Bobby, looking at his watch, swore that when duty called one
must obey, but eventually succumbed to a voice like a foghorn
shouting, &ldquo;John, a bottle of champagne,&rdquo; and the
beautiful Kate bowed approvingly from her throne.&nbsp; Kate
Hamilton at this period must have weighed at least twenty stone,
and had as hideous a physiognomy as any weather-beaten Deal
pilot.&nbsp; Seated on a raised platform, with a bodice cut very
low, this freak of nature sipped champagne steadily from midnight
until daylight, and shook like a blanc mange every time she
laughed.</p>
<p>Approached by a long tunnel from the street&mdash;where two
janitors kept watch&mdash;a pressure of the bell gave instant
admittance to a likely visitor, whilst an alarm gave immediate
notice of the approach of the police.</p>
<p>Finding oneself within the &ldquo;salon&rdquo; during one of
these periodical raids was not without interest.&nbsp; Carpets
were turned up in the twinkling of an eye, boards were raised,
and glasses and bottles&mdash;empty or full&mdash;were thrust
promiscuously in; every one assumed a sweet and virtuous air and
talked in subdued tones, whilst a bevy of police, headed by an <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>inspector,
marched solemnly in, and having completed the farce, marched
solemnly out.</p>
<p>What the subsidy attached to this duty, and when and how paid,
it is needless to inquire.&nbsp; Suffice to show that the
hypocrisy that was to attain such eminence in these latter
enlightened days was even then in its infancy, and worked as
adroitly as any twentieth-century policeman could desire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re all right,&rdquo; explained the
foghorn, as the &ldquo;salon&rdquo; resumed its normal
vivacity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bobby, my dear, come and sit next
me,&rdquo; and so, like a tomtit and a round of beef, the
pasty-faced youth took the post of honour alongside the vibrating
mass of humanity.&nbsp; The distinction conferred upon our hero
was a much-coveted one amongst youngsters, and gave a
&ldquo;hall-marking&rdquo; which henceforth proclaimed him a
&ldquo;man about town.&rdquo;&nbsp; To dispense champagne <i>ad
libitum</i> was one of its chief privileges&mdash;for the honour
was not unaccompanied with responsibilities&mdash;and Florrie or
Connie (or whoever the friend for the moment of the favoured one
might be) not only held a <i>carte blanche</i> to order
champagne, but to dispense it amongst all her acquaintances, by
way of propitiation amongst the higher grades, and as an implied
claim for reciprocity on those whose star might be in the
ascendant later on.</p>
<p>Bobby, it is needless to say, was a proud man.&nbsp; But six
months ago he had left school, and it seemed but yesterday that
loving hands of mother and sisters had vied with one another in
marking his linen and making brown holland bags with appropriate
red bindings that were to contain his brushes and other
requisites of his toilet.&nbsp; But these had long since been
discarded as &ldquo;bad form,&rdquo; and a dressing case&mdash;on
credit&mdash;with silver fittings had taken their place.&nbsp; It
had been a question, indeed, whether the pony chaise would have
to be put down to enable the worthy rector to provide the
requisite &pound;100 a year <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>that was essential over and above the
pay of a youngster in the service, and here was a young scamp
swilling champagne like water, whilst the sisters&rsquo;
allowance had been cut down to enable their brother to meet
necessary expenses, and the boy that cleaned the knives had to
look after the pony vice Simmons, the groom, dismissed.&nbsp; Not
that Bobby was vicious by nature; on the contrary, his follies
were to be attributed to that short-sighted policy that drives a
youth on the curb up to a given moment, and then gives him his
head; a lad who had never tasted anything stronger than an
aperient suddenly engulfed in a deluge of champagne.&nbsp; In
appearance he was delicate almost to effeminacy, with a gentle,
courteous address, fair curly hair waved around his silly head,
and he was popular alike with men and women.&nbsp; His good looks
were his misfortune, and his amiability of temper led him into
numerous scrapes, such as entanglements with designing chorus
girls and the accompanying folly of too much champagne with too
little money to pay for it.&nbsp; Not long previous to his
arrival in London he had fallen desperately in love at Taunton
with a strolling actress old enough to be his mother, who played
very minor parts, and whose forte was pirouetting and pointing
her huge foot at any patron in front whom she desired to signal
out for honour.&nbsp; It had taken the combined talents of the
adjutant, the rector, and George Hay to buy the sweet siren off
with a promise that her son (nearly as old as poor Bobby) should
get a berth on a sea-going merchantman.&nbsp; As a fact, he had
promised to marry the charmer, and eventually to find money to
run a company, and it was only by the accident of the show being
in pawn in a Somersetshire village (where Julia Jemima was
playing Juliet to a drunken former admirer&rsquo;s Romeo) that an
urgent appeal for funds brought the escapade to light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Julia had once said by way of
exciting <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>his enthusiasm, &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t expect you to
&lsquo;go on&rsquo; all at once, but in time you could play up to
me.&nbsp; You just study Romeo and get up Rover while
you&rsquo;re about it, and Hamlet and some of Charlie
Matthews&rsquo;s parts&mdash;you can easily knock them off, and
one part do so &rsquo;elp another, dear.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not that
Master Bobby had been brought to realise at once the histrionic
fame in store for him; on the contrary, he had jibbed
considerably at the contemplation of having to don the spangled
velvets and tights that constituted the &ldquo;property&rdquo; of
the strollers, and it was only the herculean exertions of the
lovely Julia Jemima&mdash;on her benefit night&mdash;smiling more
bewitchingly, pirouetting if possible more gracefully, and
gliding on one toe across the stage till the muscles of her
calves stood out like a Sandow&rsquo;s, that poor Bobby
succumbed, and vowed that come who, come what, nothing should
tear him from the divine creature.&nbsp; Happily our hero had not
anticipated the effects of a combined attack of adjutant and
father, and so, being rescued from one pitfall, we find him
sailing steadily towards another amidst the brilliant scenes at
Kate Hamilton&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in the profession, dear,&rdquo; Connie
was explaining as Bobby leaned over the throne to gaze on her,
&ldquo;and I often have half a mind to go back to
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; (She had once carried a banner through the run
of the pantomime at the &ldquo;Vic.&rdquo;) The word
&ldquo;profession&rdquo; acted like an electric shock; the lad
blinked as the scales appeared to fall from his eyes; Julia
Jemima appeared visibly before him; the spangles, the tights, and
the muscular calf in mid-air floated through his brain in deadly
proximity, as pulling out his watch with a shudder he bade a
hurried good-bye, and dashed off in the fleetest four-wheeler to
join the Major&rsquo;s &ldquo;lady&rdquo; under the inhospitable
walls of the Tower.</p>
<p>In the long, long ago the entertainments provided by Leicester
Square were not of an exciting nature.&nbsp; <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>The
&ldquo;Sans Souci,&rdquo; Walhalla, and Burford&rsquo;s Panorama
(where Daly&rsquo;s Theatre now stands) divided the honours till
&rsquo;51, when Wylde&rsquo;s Globe occupied the entire
enclosure.&nbsp; This huge erection was sixty feet in diameter,
and remained in existence till 1861, when it was pulled down to
make way for entertainments combining instruction with
pleasure.</p>
<p>In 1863 the &ldquo;Eldorado&rdquo; Caf&eacute; Chantant, which
was leading a precarious existence, put up the shutters, when a
section of the (non-speculative) public made the brilliant,
loyal, and dutiful suggestion that somebody should erect a
&ldquo;Denmark&rdquo; Winter Garden as a memento of the Prince of
Wales&rsquo;s recent marriage, but the loyal, dutiful,
sycophantic proposal did not commend itself as it no doubt ought
to have done, and probably would to-day.&nbsp; The requisite
capital was not forthcoming, and so not till 1873 did the new era
commence, when &pound;50,000 was offered for the Square by that
monument of aspiring greatness, &ldquo;Baron&rdquo; Grant, who
burst upon the horizon and then fizzled into space as meteors are
wont to do.</p>
<p>It is impossible to deny the fascination that Leicester Square
has for a considerable majority of Londoners.&nbsp; Up to the
days of Charles II. the entire space was composed of rustic
hedge-rows and lanes.&nbsp; Then Castle Street, Newport Street,
Cranbourne Alley, and Bear Lane came into existence, the Square
was railed round, and all the chief duels of the day were fought
within its historic precincts.</p>
<p>Lord Warwick, Lord Mountford, the Duke of Hamilton, and Lord
Mohun (a professional bully and expert shot), and a host of
smaller fry have avenged their honour within its
boundaries&mdash;and then adjourned to Locket&rsquo;s Coffee
House in its immediate vicinity.&nbsp; This ancient institution
must not be confused with the palatial establishments known as
Lockhart&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>In the days of which we are writing, Leicester Square was a
barren waste surrounded by rusty railings, <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>trodden down
in all directions; refuse of every description was shot into it,
whilst in the centre stood a dilapidated equestrian statue that
assumed various adornments as the freaks of drunken roysterers
suggested.&nbsp; On the north side (where now stands the Empire)
was The Shades, a low-class eating-house in the basement,
approached by steps, where every knife, fork and spoon was
indelibly stamped &ldquo;Stolen from The Shades&rdquo; as a
delicate hint to its patrons.&nbsp; On the opposite side stood a
huge wooden pump, of which more anon.&nbsp; At the adjoining
eastern corner were the &ldquo;tableaux vivants,&rdquo; presided
over by a judge in &ldquo;wig and gown&rdquo; where more
blasphemy and filth was to be heard for a shilling than would
appear possible, all within one hundred yards of such harmless
(if disreputable) haunts as Kate Hamilton&rsquo;s, which were
overhauled nightly.&nbsp; It was many years afterwards (July,
1874) that the barren wilderness was made beautiful for ever by
the generosity of &ldquo;Baron&rdquo; Grant.&nbsp; One can see
him now, arrayed in white waistcoat and huge buttonhole,
accompanied by an unpretentious bevy of councillors and Board of
Works men, over whom a few bits of bunting fluttered, presenting
his gift of many thousands in a speech that was quite
inaudible.&nbsp; But, like medals and decorations, gifts in those
days were not rewarded in the lavish manner of to-day.&nbsp; Had
such a public benefit been conferred now, the donor would have
been dubbed a baronet, or a privy councillor at least, with every
prospect of a peerage should he again spring &pound;20,000.&nbsp;
Apropos of this gift, there was a peculiar sequel.&nbsp; When
asked at the time whether he gave or retained the underground
rights in addition to the recreation ground, the great man, in
the zenith of his success, replied, &ldquo;Yes, yes; I give it
all.&rdquo;&nbsp; Years after, however, when poor and friendless,
hearing that underground works had made the subsoil more valuable
than the surface, he enquired whether some remnant could not <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>be claimed by
him, but was forcibly reminded of the follies of his youth by a
prompt negative, and left to die in penury without a helping
hand.</p>
<p>Perhaps never was the irony of Fate more clearly exemplified
than when, years after, two yokels who were gazing on
Shakespeare&rsquo;s monument were heard to say
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s &rsquo;im as give the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Situated exactly on the site of the Criterion Buffet was the
&ldquo;Pic,&rdquo; a dancing saloon of a decidedly inferior
class, where anybody entering (except perhaps the Angel Gabriel)
was bound to have a row.&nbsp; Hat smashing in this delectable
spot was the preliminary to a scrimmage, and when it is
recollected what &ldquo;hats&rdquo; were in the long-ago sixties,
it will be easily understood that any interference with them was
an offence to be wiped out only with blood.&nbsp; Hats, it may be
asserted without fear of contradiction, were the Alpha and Omega
of dress amongst every section of the community; the postmen wore
hats with their long scarlet coats; policemen wore hats with
their swallow-tails; boys the height of fourpence in copper wore
hats; the entire field at a cricket match wore flannels and hats;
and the yokels and agricultural classes topped their smocks with
hats.&nbsp; Not hats, be it understood, of the modern silky
limited style, but huge extinguishers, with piles varying from
solid beaver to the substance of a terrier&rsquo;s coat; and to
enter the &ldquo;Pic&rdquo; was tantamount to the annihilation of
one of these creations.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Kangaroo,&rdquo; of whom
mention is made elsewhere, was a standing dish at this
establishment, and to such an extent was his position recognised
that many men tipped him on entering to obviate molestation.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Pic,&rdquo; despite its central position, never
attained popularity, and was the resort of pickpockets, bullies,
and &ldquo;soiled doves&rdquo; of a very mediocre class.&nbsp; On
Boat Race nights, however, an organised gang of University
&ldquo;men&rdquo; invariably raided it, and by <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>smashing
everything balanced the account to a certain extent.</p>
<p>No place of amusement has passed through so many convulsions
as the edifice now known as the Alhambra.&nbsp; Erected in the
sixties, it began life as a species of polytechnic, where it was
hoped that the instruction afforded by the contemplation of two
electric batteries and a diving bell, in conjunction with the
exhilarating air of the neighbourhood, would attract sufficient
audiences to meet rent and expenses; but the venture not having
fulfilled the expectations of its youth, its portals were closed,
and it next came into prominence during the Franco-German
war.&nbsp; Here &ldquo;patriotic songs&rdquo; were the
<i>pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance</i>, and towards 11
o&rsquo;clock a dense throng waved flags and cheered and hooted
indiscriminately the &ldquo;Marseillaise,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Wacht
am Rhein,&rdquo; and everything and everybody.&nbsp; Jones,
calmly smoking, would, without the slightest provocation, assault
Brown, who was similarly innocently occupied, and who in turn
resented the polite distinction.&nbsp; Stand-up fights took place
nightly, and, as was anticipated, drew all London to the Alhambra
towards 11 o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>These indiscriminate nightly riots attracted, as may be
assumed, all the bullies and sharpers in London, amongst whom
stands prominently the &ldquo;Kangaroo,&rdquo; a gigantic black,
who was known to everybody in the sixties.&nbsp; This ruffian,
who was admittedly an expert pugilist, was the biggest coward
that hovered round Piccadilly.&nbsp; No place was free from his
unwelcome visits, and his ubiquity showed itself by his nightly
appearance at the Pavilion, the Alhambra, the Caf&eacute; Riche,
Barnes&rsquo;s, the &ldquo;Pic,&rdquo; the Blue Posts, the
Argyll, and Cremorne.&nbsp; From such places as Evans&rsquo;s and
Mott&rsquo;s he was absolutely barred, and the moral effect of
the reception he would have received deterred him&mdash;in his
wisdom&mdash;from making the attempt.</p>
<p>His <i>modus operandi</i> was simplicity itself; seating <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>himself at
some inoffensive man&rsquo;s table, he helped himself to anything
he might find within reach; if remonstrated with, he knocked the
remonstrator down, and coolly walked out of the room.</p>
<p>On other occasions he would demand money, and if refused,
applied the same remedy; if a party were seated at the Alhambra
watching the performance, a black arm would suddenly appear over
one&rsquo;s shoulder, and glass by glass was lifted and coolly
drained.&nbsp; Occasionally he met his match, when, having
pocketed his thrashing, he commenced afresh in an adjoining
night-house.</p>
<p>A plethora of coloured ex-prizefighters roamed about these
latitudes in the long-ago sixties.&nbsp; Plantagenet Green, an
admittedly scientific boxer unaccompanied by any heart, was
everywhere much in evidence, and Bob Travers, one of the best and
pluckiest that ever contested the middle-weight championship,
might have been seen years after selling chutnee in the
streets.&nbsp; In those unenlightened days prizefighters,
although made much of, never forgot their place, and the
illiterate abortions in rabbit-skin collars that intrude into
every public resort at the present day and dub themselves
&ldquo;professors&rdquo; were creations happily unknown.</p>
<p>Needless to add that the Alhambra, with its miscellaneous
attractions, stood very high in the estimation of our subalterns,
or a considerable portion who deferred to Bobby on all matters
relating to &ldquo;form.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Armed with diminutive flags of every nationality in Europe, a
select team were one evening enjoying the delights that led up to
the &ldquo;patriotic era,&rdquo; as sitting around a table on the
balcony they agreed upon the rendezvous should
circumstances&mdash;and the fights&mdash;separate them.&nbsp;
Ladies, moreover, graced the board, and sipped from time to time
the exhilarating fluid that sparkled in various tumblers.&nbsp;
George <a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>Hay
meanwhile was explaining to an interested houri how by an
extraordinary coincidence red, white, and blue predominated in
most of the National colours of Europe, while Bobby was urging
some argument on a fair creature in inaudible tones, when an
apparition a yard long, and as black as ebony, passed over his
head and deliberately seized a tumbler.&nbsp; Dazed for a moment,
and ignorant of the notoriety of the &ldquo;Kangaroo,&rdquo; one
and all sat spellbound as the ruffian deliberately emptied the
glass and replaced it on the table.</p>
<p>George was the first to grasp the situation, as, springing
from his chair, he confronted the bully, and inquired:
&ldquo;What are we to understand by this?&rdquo;&nbsp; But,
&ldquo;What you d&mdash; please!&rdquo; was barely out of his
mouth when a swinging blow on the jaw sent him staggering towards
the counter.</p>
<p>Dropping his cane and hat, the &ldquo;Kangaroo&rdquo; now
advanced in an attitude that meant business, and dashing in his
long left arm, essayed to fell George with one blow.&nbsp; But
his adversary was prepared for this, and springing back lightly,
got beyond danger.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Kangaroo&rsquo;s&rdquo; arms,
when reposing by his side, reached almost to his knees, and gave
him an incalculable advantage with any but the most nimble.&nbsp;
Realising this fact, George decided to change his tactics, and to
direct all his blows for the neck or body of his opponent; he had
been taught, indeed, that a negro&rsquo;s head is practically
invulnerable, but that a swinging slog in the loins would double
up the most seasoned.&nbsp; A shower of blows now rattled on the
black&rsquo;s sides, as springing out of danger after every
onslaught, the &ldquo;Kangaroo&rdquo; began to show signs of
distress; standing well out of range, he appeared but to wait the
opportunity, and picking up his hat and cane, he bolted down the
stairs.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Kangaroo&rdquo; had learnt a lesson, and was
profoundly ignorant of the fact that his <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>meek-looking
opponent had a heart as big as a lion&rsquo;s and was a pupil of
Ben Caunt.</p>
<p>But patriotism and loyalism of the blatant type are apt to
cloy even on the most gushing, and the fever pitch having been
attained, the cooling process set in, and then a series of
experiments ensued to try and keep up the demand for the disrated
Alhambra.</p>

48</span>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE NIGHT HOUSES OF THE
HAYMARKET.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">If</span> any of the Bucks of the sixties
were suddenly brought to life and placed in the centre of
Piccadilly Circus, no labyrinth could more completely puzzle them
than the structural alterations of to-day.&nbsp; Abutting on to
where Shaftesbury Avenue commences was a dismal row of houses,
with here and there an outlet into the purlieus of more dismal
Soho; where the obstruction for the accommodation of
flower-sellers now raises its useless head, another block of
houses ran eastwards, dividing the present broad expanse into two
narrow thoroughfares; the huge monument to the profitable
industry in intoxicating drinks takes the place of the ancient
&ldquo;Pic,&rdquo; and the Haymarket, from the exalted position
of centre of the surging mass of nocturnal corruption, has
descended to the status of a dimly-lighted thoroughfare, with
here and there an unlicensed Italian restaurant and a sprinkling
of second-class pot-houses.</p>
<p>Instead of the promenade from which strollers are now hustled
off the pavement by a zealous police, the strip between Windmill
Street and the Raleigh Club was the favoured lounge, and the
Haymarket literally blazed with light (till daylight) from such
temples as the &ldquo;Blue Posts,&rdquo; Barnes&rsquo;s, The
Burmese, and Barron&rsquo;s Oyster Rooms.&nbsp; This latter
place, although palpably suffering from old age and the ravages
of time, and propped up by beams innumerable, <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>was the
nightly rendezvous of oyster-eaters, where, sandwiched in between
&ldquo;loose boxes&rdquo; upstairs and down, champagne and other
drinks were consumed to excess.</p>
<p>Often amid these sounds of revelry, ominous cracks and groans
warned the revellers that all was not right, till on one
never-to-be-forgotten night a sound that vibrated like the crack
of doom caused a stampede, and leaving wine, oysters, hats,
unpaid bills, every one rushed helter-skelter into the
street.&nbsp; Old Barron, staring disconsolately from the
pavement at his fast-collapsing house, suddenly appeared to
remember that his cash-box was in the doomed building, and
rushing frantically in, was seen hurrying out with the prized
treasure.&nbsp; And then a crash that might have quailed the
stoutest heart rang through the night, and Barron, cash-box, and
lights, all disappeared in a cloud of dust that ascended up to
heaven.&nbsp; Days after the old man was found firmly clutching
his treasure.&nbsp; Let us hope its possession compensated him in
his passage across the Styx.</p>
<p>The decorous Panton Street of to-day was another very sink of
iniquity.&nbsp; Night houses abounded, and Rose Burton&rsquo;s
and Jack Percival&rsquo;s were sandwiched between hot baths of
questionable respectability and abominations of every kind.&nbsp;
Stone&rsquo;s Coffee House was the only redeeming feature, and,
as it existed in those days, was a very spring of water in a dry
land.</p>
<p>But it must not be assumed that, although Percival&rsquo;s was
a &ldquo;night house,&rdquo; it was to be classed with its next
door neighbours.&nbsp; Here the sporting fraternity radiated
after all important events; here Heenan lodged after his fight
with Tom King; and one can see him&mdash;as if it were
yesterday&mdash;receiving his friends and backers on the
following Sunday with his handsome features incrusted in plaster
of Paris and smiling as if he had been awarded the victory he was
undoubtedly choused out of.</p>
<p><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>But
perhaps no spot has undergone more structural and social change
than Arundel Place, an unpretentious court that leads out of
Coventry Street.&nbsp; At one corner now stands a
tobacconist&rsquo;s shop, and at the other an eating bar, where
hunks of provender are devoured at the counter, and cocoa
retailed at a penny a bucket; whilst the court itself is
practically absorbed by the Civil Service Stores, through whose
windows &ldquo;gentlemen&rdquo; may be seen weighing out coffee,
and &ldquo;bald-headed noblemen&rdquo; tying up parcels.</p>
<p>In the sixties, however, the place had considerably more
vitality&mdash;after nightfall.&nbsp; On the eastern side stood a
public-house of unenviable repute, owned by an ex-prizefighter,
to which the fraternity congregated in considerable numbers;
whilst at the end furthest from Coventry Street was a
coffee-house, whose open portals discovered nothing more
dangerous than an oil-clothed floor, chairs and tables over its
surface, and an unassuming counter for the supply of moderate
refreshments.&nbsp; During the day a spirit of repose pervaded
the entire area; the public-house appeared to be doing little or
no trade, whilst the coffee-house was chiefly remarkable for the
persistent scrubbing and emptying of buckets that went on, as a
mechanical charwoman, in the inevitable bonnet, oscillated to and
fro between the door and the pavement.&nbsp; But for the old
woman, and an occasional apparition in a startling check costume
that flashed in and out between the coffee-house and the
pot-house, one might have imagined the entire place was
uninhabited, so subdued and reposeful was everything.</p>
<p>Tall and angular by nature, with skin-tight overalls and a
coat the colour of a Camden Town &rsquo;bus, Jerry Fry was the
undisputed landlord of the unpretentious coffee-house, and
recognised director of a gang of sharpers who made human nature
their study, and scoured the highways and byways nightly in
search of profitable quarry.&nbsp; Not that the above costume was
<a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>the sole
one in Jerry&rsquo;s extensive wardrobe, which boasted amongst
others the huge cape and whip associated with rustic drivers, a
clerical outfit, evening clothes, and a white tie the size of a
poultice.&nbsp; Jerry as a strategist was without a rival, and it
requires but little effort of imagination to assume that he has
turned in his grave times innumerable in the contemplation of the
sorry sharpers of the present era who have usurped his functions
in the despoiling of their species.&nbsp; Any promising subject
that appeared on the horizon immediately became the object of
Jerry&rsquo;s personal solicitude, and once the victim&rsquo;s
besetting sin was accurately diagnosed, no time was lost in
placing a specialist on his unsuspecting track.&nbsp; It was not
long after the arrival of the &ldquo;Line&rdquo; garrison in
London that George Hay was focussed as an inveterate gambler, and
as the &ldquo;Landed Gentry&rdquo; vouched for his being the
eldest son of a county magnate, no time was lost in laying lines
in every direction in the hope of catching him.&nbsp; Not that
play&mdash;in which he was by no means an expert&mdash;was his
only delight; on the contrary, he excelled in every kind of manly
sport, and could hold his own with the gloves with many a man who
had the advantage of him in height and weight.</p>
<p>When in the country cards never entered his mind; in London,
however, with the fascination ever before him, the temptation was
irresistible, and the three fly-blown cards of a racecourse
manipulator or <i>chemin de fer</i> at the Arlington held him
like a vice whilst the fever was upon him.</p>
<p>It was a sultry evening in September when everybody (except
four millions) was out of town that George and Bobby elected to
stroll to the West End after an uneventful dinner at mess.&nbsp;
Threading their way through the slums that abutted on the Tower,
nothing worthy of record occurred till, casually stopping to
light a cigar, they were accosted on the <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>threshold of
Leicester Square by a courteous individual who asked for a
light.</p>
<p>George was nothing if he was not a gentleman, and without
waiting to consider why the person should seek a light from him
when gas jets were blazing outside every shop, he considerately
acceded.</p>
<p>But the stranger apparently was of a sociable disposition, and
persisted in hanging on to their skirts and essaying remarks on
objects on their way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have we here?&rdquo; he inquired as, passing
Arundel Place, a dense crowd outside the pot-house riveted his
attention.&nbsp; &ldquo;The fight, of course,&rdquo; he
continued, &ldquo;the seconds and backers are squaring up, I
expect.&nbsp; Will you step in, gentlemen, it&rsquo;s all right,
but I&rsquo;d better perhaps go in and inquire, they all know me;
one minute, gents, by your leave,&rdquo; and he disappeared into
the crowded court.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we go in, George,&rdquo; inquired Bobby,
&ldquo;or have a peep at the &lsquo;Pic&rsquo;?&nbsp; D&mdash;
it! we must have some sport after twenty-four hours of the
Tower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go in?&nbsp; Of course we will if there&rsquo;s
anything to be seen,&rdquo; answered George; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
half-inclined to shake up my liver by arranging with Ben Caunt to
resume my &lsquo;studies&rsquo; at the Tower, and there&rsquo;s
one consolation, Bobby, it&rsquo;s not as expensive as the
Arlington, and we haven&rsquo;t much to lose if they do pick our
pockets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So summed up the situation Solon George, as their cicerone
made his reappearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, gents; step this way,&rdquo; intimated the
stranger; &ldquo;but we had best wait awhile in the coffee-house
yonder; leave it to me to give you the tip,&rdquo; and without
further ado they all entered the hostelry.</p>
<p>George, with all his common sense, was a very tyro in the
rudiments of the unwritten law of knavery, and certainly no match
for a shrewd London rascal; to enter into conversation with an
absolute stranger <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>appeared nothing extraordinary to him, and when a
punching match was the basis of the acquaintance, and the chance
of meeting certain leading&mdash;if illiterate&mdash;lights of
the fraternity the prospect, conventionalism with him was an
infinitesimal quantity, and he entered into the sport with the
enthusiasm of a schoolboy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why here?&rdquo; inquired George, as they found
themselves the sole occupants of the oilclothed room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit, gents, they&rsquo;ll come presently,&rdquo;
replied their cicerone; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given them the office,
but they&rsquo;re a bit busy just now settling up the scores for
this morning, maybe.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then he proceeded with what
purported to be a personal description of the fight, looking
frequently at a huge clock that ticked in the corner, and
fervently hoping that Jerry would not be long.</p>
<p>Bobby meanwhile was champing his bit, and bewailing the time
that might so much more profitably have been passed at the
&ldquo;Pic,&rdquo; when a man in the immaculate disguise of a
coachman walked hurriedly through the room.&nbsp; Peering into
every corner, and examining crevices that a cat would have been
incommoded in, he hurriedly approached our heroes, and asked
excitedly whether they had seen a gentleman such as he
described.&nbsp; Without waiting for a reply, he next dropped his
whip and rug on to a vacant chair, and whipping out a pack of
cards, continued: &ldquo;It drives me mad to think I should have
lost such a stupid game; but I was drunk, gentlemen&mdash;forgive
the admission&mdash;yes, drunk; but he has promised me my revenge
here to-night,&rdquo; and pulling out a watch the size of a
frying-pan, he contemplated it as if wrapt in thought.&nbsp;
Replacing it with a spasmodic jerk, he continued: &ldquo;Just
fancy, gentlemen, this was the simple thing; but I was drunk,
alas!&mdash;happy thought, &rsquo;ware drink,&rdquo; and he gave
a halloa such as foxhunters <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>give on the stage, and proceeded to
rattle three cards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, gentlemen, just for fun, which is the
knave?&rdquo;&nbsp; And Bobby, without a check, selected the
correct cardboard.&nbsp; &ldquo;Again, gentlemen, if you please,
it will bring my hand into practice; shall we say half a
crown?&nbsp; Thanks!&rdquo; and again, with the accuracy of a
truffle dog, Bobby discovered the card.</p>
<p>Again and again was this farce perpetrated, till Bobby&rsquo;s
winnings amounted to &pound;4, and in his generosity he seemed
loth to take advantage of such a greenhorn.</p>
<p>George meanwhile had caught the infection and bet and won as
the stakes were made higher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five pounds for once, gentlemen?&nbsp; I think
I&rsquo;ve earned my revenge,&rdquo; pleaded Jerry, and fickle
Fortune as if of the same opinion, decided in his favour.</p>
<p>Any one but the veriest tyro would have deemed this a
favourable opportunity to stop, but George, as we have seen, had
his own ideas of honour; the fever, moreover, was upon him, and,
producing the contents of his own pocket, he again backed his
opinion.</p>
<p>Gone in a twinkling, he next turned to Bobby, and the lad at
once proceeded to supply him with his cash.&nbsp; Meanwhile their
original acquaintance whispered imploringly to George to have
done with it, but he might as well have spoken to the
winds.&nbsp; &ldquo;D&mdash; it, man, if I&rsquo;m cleaned out of
ready money I&rsquo;ve still my ring and sleeve links; go on,
sir,&rdquo; he continued to Jerry.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet my
jewellery against a tenner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But fortune was still against our friends, and divested of his
trinkets, in his turn he appealed to his opponent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, sir, I gave you your revenge, now give me mine,
and anything I lose I&rsquo;ll give you my cheque for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jerry was of a practical nature; cheques <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>were
occasionally stopped, and officious detectives might come to hear
of it, so he decided to decline the tempting offer, but promised
revenge on the morrow.&nbsp; The first stranger meanwhile came to
the rescue.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re a gentleman,&rdquo;
he whispered, &ldquo;and mayn&rsquo;t like to lose those things,
why not offer the gent to redeem them to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idea seemed a happy one, and the party dispersed, on the
understanding that at twelve the following day they should all
meet at the Pump in Leicester Square.</p>
<p>But our heroes were not yet done with casual acquaintances, as
passing along the Haymarket they were again accosted by a
man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Excuse me, gentlemen,&rdquo; was the abrupt
introduction, &ldquo;I saw you parting company just now with two
well-known sharpers; I&rsquo;m Detective Bulger of the police,
may I ask if you&rsquo;ve been robbed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then the painful truth began to dawn upon the victims that
two officers in Her Majesty&rsquo;s Service had been overreached
at a game that a Blue-coat boy would have jibbed at.</p>
<p>The sequel is briefly told.&nbsp; The next day the appointment
was punctually kept by all except Jerry, who, oddly enough,
deputed another man to explain that he was sending off an urgent
telegram, and had requested him (if the coast was clear) to
conduct our friends to him.</p>
<p>Followed at a respectful distance by the detective, the
jewellery was duly redeemed; but just as Jerry was pocketing the
money, a hand was laid upon his shoulder, and he found himself in
the clutches of Sergeant Bulger.</p>
<p>George refused to prosecute; his money was however, restored
to him, and binding Bobby to secrecy, he thus escaped the chaff
that would have cleaved to him for life.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Kitchen&rdquo; was situated in St. Martin&rsquo;s
Court, <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>abutting on Castle Street, now known as Charing Cross
Road; adjoining it was a famous <i>&agrave; la mode</i> house
kept by two brothers, each of whom could turn the scale at thirty
stone.&nbsp; It was explained by way of accounting for this
extraordinary freak of nature that, by never leaving the
establishment and inhaling the greasy fumes from night to
morning, their pores were constantly imbibing from a thousand
sources the oleaginous vapours that conduce to obesity; be that
as it may, the entire front of an upper chamber had to be removed
to allow of the usual formalities of Christian burial when one of
the firm died, and it is doubtful if the place was not afterwards
demolished.</p>
<p>Here nightly were to be found actors since known to fame;
journalists such as Horace (Pony) Mayhew and his brother Gus,
George Augustus Sala&mdash;then writing to measure&mdash;and a
sprinkling of golden calves with theatrical proclivities.&nbsp;
The refreshments, of course, left nothing to be desired on the
score of satisfying, and <i>&agrave; la mode</i> gravy in pewter
pots stimulated many a jaded reveller during the small hours of
the morning.</p>
<p>It was on our way to this refined hostelry that we on one
occasion met Polly Amherst, and the sequel was so absurd that I
give the story special prominence.</p>
<p>Polly was a delightful companion.&nbsp; Just down from Oxford,
he was destined to take up a fat family living in the
neighbourhood of Sevenoaks, but being seen one night in a
bird&rsquo;s eye tie amid the revels of Cremorne, and the birds
of the air having carried it to his bishop, it was pointed out to
the worthy fellow that free scope for his undoubted talent was
impossible in the Church, and so posterity was the loser of much
pulpit oratory that would doubtless have thrilled the present
generation.</p>
<p>As we entered the &ldquo;Kitchen&rdquo; Jack Coney&mdash;a
promoted scene-shifter lately come into prominence <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>by his
marriage with Rose Burton&mdash;was retailing to the assembled
revellers the spot which had been kept secret to the last moment
where a big fight was to take place in the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; replied George Hay to
someone&rsquo;s inquiry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too seedy,&rdquo; continued Bobby, who had
not spared the punch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, too,&rdquo; added Oliver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to, but I daren&rsquo;t,&rdquo; chimed in
Polly.&nbsp; And so a detachment was added to the contingent that
were piloted by the irrepressible Coney.</p>
<p>Bobby during the past night had, alas! not followed the paths
of sobriety, and so it came to pass that the blind agreed to lead
the blind, and Polly Amherst and Harry Turner (a genial comedian)
agreed to escort him to the Hummums.</p>
<p>Passing Hart&rsquo;s Coffee House we, of course, &ldquo;looked
in,&rdquo; and, sure enough, there was Hastings and a dozen boon
companions; but the night air had been too much for many of us;
we saw a dozen Marquises and only one boon companion, so taking
the wisest resolve we had taken that night, we bade each other
farewell on the steps of the Hummums, and proceeded to our
virtuous couches.</p>
<p>Arising late on the following afternoon, a circumstance
occurred that drove everything else out of my head, and to the
elucidation of this inexplicable coincidence are to be attributed
the monotonous details I have just described.</p>
<p>It was towards three on the following afternoon, when, having
completed a refreshing toilette, my left arm was entering my
sleeve that I became aware of a foreign substance that bulged to
an abnormal extent the inner pocket of my coat; proceeding to
examine the cause with that self-possession for which I was so
justly conspicuous, my equanimity was considerably tried by
coming into contact with <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>a watch; extracting it carefully, I
discovered that it was attached to a massive chain adorned with
numerous seals and lockets.&nbsp; Surprised, I continued my
investigations, my surprise turning to anxiety as a second watch
(a repeater) made its appearance.&nbsp; By this time thoroughly
alarmed, I dived again, and out came three or four rings and a
purse stuffed full of sovereigns.&nbsp; Fairly staggered, my
<i>sang-froid</i> left me, and reeling towards the bed, I
endeavoured to solve the mystery.</p>
<p>Had I in my cups robbed a jeweller&rsquo;s?&nbsp; Had I picked
somebody&rsquo;s pocket?&nbsp; Had I had a row, and after the
fray put on my opponent&rsquo;s coat?&nbsp; But every argument
failed to elucidate the mystery, and my thoughts wandered to such
an extent that in it all I saw a distinct judgment on my
back-sliding.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, I knew not where Amherst or Harry
Turner resided, and so resolved to have breakfast and await
developments.</p>
<p>But breakfast under such circumstances was a sorry farce;
every gulp of tea appeared to choke me, and in every waiter who
approached I recognised a constable on the track of the
burglar.&nbsp; Flesh and blood could not long stand this strain,
and my pent-up feelings received a still greater shock by the
waiter thrusting a card into my hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ask him
in,&rdquo; I replied, and Harry Turner, with a face a yard long,
hurriedly shuffled towards me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An awful thing has occurred,&rdquo; began the unhappy
mummer, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve come to you in the hope that
you&rsquo;ll be able to explain it.&nbsp; Look at this,&rdquo; he
continued, as he proceeded to untie a bundle.&nbsp; &ldquo;When I
was putting on my coat just now I found two watches, a
cheque-book, a ring, and a packet of papers.&nbsp; Can you
recollect what we did?&nbsp; By Gad, I&rsquo;m half disposed to
go and give myself up.&nbsp; One would get off lighter then,
perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whilst we were discussing ways and means, a second <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>card was
brought to me, and again the waiter was requested to &ldquo;show
him in,&rdquo; and then Polly Amherst came upon the scene, the
ghost of his former self, pale and haggard, but otherwise
externally irreproachable as regards white tie and High Church
clerical attire.&nbsp; &ldquo;Billy,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;a
terrible thing has occurred, and I&rsquo;ve come here in the
hopes that you will be able to set my mind at rest.&nbsp;
Conceive my horror, when opening my eyes this afternoon, to see
at my bedside a watch, a pile of sovereigns, and a valuable
ring.&nbsp; What silly jokes did we indulge in last night, old
man?&nbsp; &rsquo;Pon my word as I came here I shuddered as I
passed a policeman.&nbsp; The matter can&rsquo;t rest here.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve locked the accursed things in my portmanteau, and now
what&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the consolation he received from his dismal companions in
no way tended to allay his anxiety.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have neither
of us the smallest conception of how we became possessed of these
things,&rdquo; replied Turner, &ldquo;and it seems to me our only
course is to walk round to Bow Street and voluntarily give
ourselves up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our teeth had now begun to chatter, and, hoping against hope,
we agreed it would be best to await George Hay&rsquo;s return,
and act as he should advise.</p>
<p>Three weary hours later, George Hay, Oliver Montagu, the
irrepressible Jack Coney, and Harry Ashley (afterwards of <i>Pink
Dominoes</i> fame), returned from the fight, and it having been
arranged that the three latter should be permitted to depart
before the culprits broke the news to George, a magnum was called
for by way of a stirrup cup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, Polly,&rdquo; remarked Montagu, &ldquo;I
may as well relieve you of my gimcracks, and, by Gad, it&rsquo;s
as well we didn&rsquo;t take them.&nbsp; Did you ever see a
rougher lot?&rdquo; he added, turning to George.</p>
<p>And then a cloud rose from off the countenances of Polly,
Harry Turner, and myself; the magnum <a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>that had hitherto tasted like jalap
appeared as nectar to our lips, and we began to recollect that
prior to leaving the &ldquo;Kitchen&rdquo; our comrades had
entrusted their valuables to us.</p>
<p>We never told our terrible experience.</p>
<h2><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">EVANS&rsquo;S AND THE DIALS.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> the Embankment came into
existence, Salisbury Street and Cecil Street&mdash;where the
hotel now stands&mdash;consisted for the most part of lodging
houses.&nbsp; Overlooking the river, stairs led to shanties to
which wherries were moored, whilst a verandah, running the entire
length of the house in which I once had rooms, enabled shade and
muddy breezes to be indulged in during the hot summer
evenings.&nbsp; At the side could be seen the arches known as Fox
Hill, which, still visible from the (now) Tivoli Music Hall, were
in those days capable of being traversed for a considerable
distance.</p>
<p>In ancient days the haunt of smugglers and desperadoes, it had
not lost its popularity with the lawless classes even in the more
modern long-ago sixties, and weird stories of murders that had
never been discovered, and crimes of every description, were
currently reported as of almost daily occurrence in the
impenetrable &ldquo;dark arches of the Adelphi.&rdquo;&nbsp; No
sane person would have ventured to explore them unless
accompanied by an armed escort, and even Wych Street, Newcastle
Street, and Holywell Street were &ldquo;out of bounds&rdquo;
after nightfall.</p>
<p>The dead body of a female having one morning been discovered,
it was currently reported that the assassin was in concealment in
the &ldquo;dark arches;&rdquo; the police&mdash;from information
received&mdash;were <a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>convinced of it, and the authorities, having a mind to
probe the mystery, organised search parties, which scattered
amongst the labyrinths, and eventually emerged no nearer an
elucidation than before.</p>
<p>Passages, it was asserted, led to various exits on the river
bank, and extended in an easterly direction to Whitefriars, all
of which in later years have been gradually filled up till now
nothing more pernicious than a peaceful beer-store a few yards
from the entrance and an occasional board-man who ought to be
traversing the street, give signs of vitality to what was once a
sink of iniquity.</p>
<p>It is refreshing after this weird retrospect to turn to the
modern Adelphi Terrace, where years ago I participated in many
enjoyable reunions.&nbsp; Here each Sunday night such lively
company as the late Kate Vaughan and her husband, Freddy
Wellesley, Billy Hill, Marius, Florence St. John, Sweet Nell
Hazel, and other vestals congregated; whilst the
&ldquo;Savages&rdquo; have made it their headquarters, and can
lean over the balcony without risking typhoid, and eventually
cross the Strand at no greater risk than an invitation to air
their French.</p>
<p>And the changes in the Adelphi suggest the changes that have
taken place in other historical resorts, than which nothing has
been more marked than in the Burlington Arcade.&nbsp; Here every
afternoon, between six and seven, throngs composed of all that
made up the pomp and vanity of this wicked world disported
themselves.&nbsp; Here Baby Jordan and
&ldquo;Shoes&rdquo;&mdash;since become the mother of a
present-day baronet&mdash;Nelly Fowler, and Nelly Clifton held
court with their attendant squires and lords of every
degree.&nbsp; Here at seven the entire mass surged towards the
Blue Posts in Cork street and indulged in champagne and caviare
toast.&nbsp; Here about the same time Hastings, Fred Granville,
and roysterers of a more pronounced type looked in for a
breakfast of &ldquo;fixed bayonets&rdquo; by way of appetite <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>for the
dinner at Limmer&rsquo;s that most of them would barely
touch.&nbsp; Here (in Cork Street) a little head might be seen
cautiously peeping over the blinds at No. 17 in the hope that
some eligible client might seek pecuniary relief before entering
on the night&rsquo;s enjoyment.&nbsp; Here in later years the
same head, but transformed into the appearance of a Fitzroy storm
signal, might be seen more shiny, more haughtily posed, dictating
terms to Lairds of Aboyne and owners of Derby favourites.&nbsp;
After which the rich man died, and the shekels made by usury have
gone (as was only right) to bolster up impecunious subalterns and
Christian hospitals.</p>
<p>In the palmy days of Paddy Green, Evans&rsquo;s provided
perhaps the only tavern where a weary sojourner might sit in
peace and realise that he was surrounded by comfort and
tone.&nbsp; Hovering near the door was the genial old proprietor,
with white hair and rubicund face, a smile for every one, and
capable of passing anywhere for a chairman of directors at
least.&nbsp; Around the walls were the priceless oil paintings
belonging to the Garrick, deposited temporarily after the fire
that made havoc with that historical building; whilst covering
the entire floor were tables where the best (and the best only)
of chops, steaks, mealy potatoes, and welsh rabbits, with wines
of heaven knows what age, beer, and spirits were procurable.</p>
<p>Nor must the old establishment be confounded with the modern
fungus that continued its name under the pilotage of an
enterprising Jew, and eventually got closed by the police for
developing into an ordinary night house.</p>
<p>To see a genuine old English waiter crumble a huge potato with
a spotless napkin creates a pang when one thinks of his German
and Italian prototype asking &ldquo;&rsquo;Ow many breads you
have?&rdquo; and on being told &ldquo;one,&rdquo; looking as if
he could swear you had had two.</p>
<p>And no accounts were discharged at <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>the time&mdash;sit, as one might,
from 10 to 2 a.m., and eat and drink variously, and as often as
one pleased&mdash;all the reckoning was one&rsquo;s own as one
imparted it on leaving to the most courteous of butlers at the
door.</p>
<p>And then the stage, what comparison is possible between the
healthy singing of glees and solos one then heard and the
elephantine wit of the modern serio-comic?&nbsp; And poor old Van
Joel, who, as the programme explained, was retained on account of
past services, retailing cigars in the hall and obtaining fancy
prices for &ldquo;Auld Lang Syne&rdquo;&mdash;how a lump comes
even now into one&rsquo;s knotty, hoary old throat at the
recollections of these long-agos!</p>
<p>Monotonous as all this may sound to the modern up-to-date
sightseer, there was a homeliness and an indescribable delight
associated with Evans&rsquo;s that surely the recording angel
will not fail to remember when he sums up the sins of the
sixties.</p>
<p>Across the market, again, was a hostelry, long since
disappeared except in name, &ldquo;The Hummums,&rdquo; and who
shall find to-day such rare old English fare, served on silver by
the most typical of English waiters?</p>
<p>The rooms may have been dingy, the smoking-room a little
stuffy, but the spirit of Bob Garnham must surely hover over the
modern imitation that has arisen on its ashes and assumed
everything but its indescribable comfort.</p>
<p>The approaches to Evans&rsquo;s after dark were by no means
free of danger in the long-ago sixties.&nbsp; The market porters,
who for the most part were cut-purses and pugilists, were apt to
waylay solitary foot passengers whilst awaiting the arrival of
the vegetable vans, and I recollect an Uxbridge farmer named
Hillyard entering the hotel one night with a broken wrist after
being waylaid and robbed in Russell Street.</p>
<p>The old Olympic, hard by, was another nasty place <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>to leave
after the performance, except in a cab.&nbsp; Within fifty yards
the alleys bristled with footpads, and any foolhardy pedestrian
traversing the dimly-lighted Drury Lane or Newcastle Street was
pretty sure not to reach civilisation without a very rough
experience from the denizens of Vinegar Yard and Betterton
Street.</p>
<p>The Forty Thieves were an organised bevy of sirens, whose
headquarters were the Seven Dials, and whose mission it was to
entice, decoy, and cajole any fool who had the temerity to listen
to their cooing.</p>
<p>The Clock House on the Dials, now an apparently well-conducted
pot-house, was in those days a hotbed of villainy.&nbsp; The king
of pickpockets there held his nightly lev&eacute;e, and the
half-dozen constables within view would no more have thought of
entering it than they would the cage of a cobra.</p>
<p>If a man lost a dog the reward was offered there; if
one&rsquo;s watch disappeared it was there that immediate
application was desirable; and if the emissary was not
&ldquo;saucy&rdquo; he might with luck save it from the
melting-pot that simmered all day and all night within fifty feet
of Aldridge&rsquo;s horse repository.</p>
<p>The walk through the Dials after dark was an act none but a
lunatic would have attempted, and the betting that he ever
emerged with his shirt was 1,000 to 60.&nbsp; A swaggering ass
named Corrigan, whose personal bravery was not assessed as highly
by the public, once undertook for a wager to walk the entire
length of Great Andrew Street at midnight, and if molested to
annihilate his assailants.</p>
<p>The half-dozen doubters who awaited his advent in the Broadway
were surprised about 1 a.m. to see him running as fast as he
could put legs to the ground, with only the remnant of a shirt on
him; after recovering his breath and his courage he proceeded to
describe the terrific slaughter he had inflicted on an
innumerable number of assailants.&nbsp; A scurrilous <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>print that
flourished about this time in its next issue narrated the
incident in verse by: &ldquo;Oh, pray for the souls that Corrigan
kilt,&rdquo; etc.&nbsp; Corrigan, it may be added, was an
Irishman, and not a particularly veracious one.</p>
<p>Any list of queer fish would be incomplete without introducing
the name of Bill Holland, who, although he struggled on till the
eighties, was in his zenith in the sixties.&nbsp; Rosherville
being too far, and Vauxhall having disappeared, the North
Woolwich Gardens came into favour with those who sought
recreation of a less boisterous kind than that at Cremorne.</p>
<p>Bill Holland had all his life been a showman; amusing and full
of exaggerated anecdote, he had catered for the public from time
immemorial; every monstrosity had at some period passed through
his hands; every woman over seven feet, and every man under four,
had appeared under his auspices: the tattooed nobleman, the
dog-faced man, the whiskered lady&mdash;all recognised him as
master at one period or another.&nbsp; He had
&ldquo;directed&rdquo; the Alhambra, the Surrey, the Blackpool
Gardens, and, in later years, the Battersea Palace, and signally
failed with each; but, sphinx-like, he invariably reappeared
irreproachably groomed and waxed, with some confiding creature
ready to finance him.&nbsp; His constant companion was Joe Pope,
an abnormally fat little man, and a brother of the Q.C. who not
long ago died.&nbsp; It was the brains of this obese little man,
in conjunction with Bill Holland&rsquo;s assurance, that kept the
wheels going for over thirty years.</p>
<p>Across the river at Greenwich were the historical Trafalgar
and Ship Taverns, where the famous fish dinners, served in the
very best style, were procurable.&nbsp; Only fish, but prepared
and served in irreproachable form; beginning with boiled
flounder, one progressed by seven stages of salmon in various
forms, filleted sole, fried eel, each with its special sauce,
till whitebait <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>plain and whitebait devilled found the wayfarer
well-nigh exhausted.</p>
<p>It was only then that the folly of ordering dinner on a hungry
stomach became manifest, and when the duckling that the smiling
waiter had suggested made its appearance it was almost with tears
that one turned away from its pleading savour and reluctantly
confessed one&rsquo;s inability to do it justice.&nbsp; And then
the coffee on the lawn, and the scrambling for coppers amongst
the water arabs in the surging mud below, were adjuncts that
never failed in the completing of enjoyable evenings now for ever
gone.</p>
<p>Why the resort went out of fashion seems an enigma.&nbsp;
Forty, thirty, aye, twenty years ago both taverns were the almost
daily resorts, during the summer and autumn, of the highest in
the land.&nbsp; In one private room would be heard Her
Majesty&rsquo;s judges, cracking jokes as if they were incapable
of judicial sternness; in another legislators by the score, who
had travelled down by special steamer to eat and drink as if no
such things as fiscal questions existed; whilst in the public
room cosy couples dined, and roysterers smoked and joked, and yet
all has passed like a pleasant dream.&nbsp; The Trafalgar has
long since been pulled down, the Ship, if not closed, is very
much changed for the worse, and Londoners swelter annually with
the patience of Job, and are apparently indifferent to the
delightful resorts they have lost.</p>
<p>It was during a May meeting, when rural deans and other
provincial Church luminaries were staying at Haxell&rsquo;s and
the Golden Cross Hotels, that Satan prompted certain roysterers
to raid these establishments when the reverend lodgers might be
supposed to have retired to their respective closets.&nbsp; It
was Nassau Clarke&mdash;a subaltern in the Life Guards&mdash;who
conceived the brilliant idea, and collecting Jacob Burt, Charlie
Buller, Lennon, and a few other well-known roysterers, we
proceeded towards the Strand.&nbsp; The <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>joke, if such
it may be called, was to change every pair of boots reposing
peacefully outside the various doors, and the
development&mdash;which none of us was likely to
witness&mdash;was the scare that would ensue at 8 a.m., when
sober ecclesiastics might be expected to swear at the prospect of
being late for their platform prayer at 9.&nbsp; Charlie Buller
in those days was reputedly the handsomest man in the Household
Brigade; an excellent bruiser, and not slow of wrath, he was,
moreover, a desirable companion when altercations were likely to
occur.</p>
<p>Lennon, on the other hand, was not a cockney, and only up on
leave, but willing to assist in anything original or
exciting.&nbsp; Not many months previously he had been awarded a
brevet-majority and the Victoria Cross for a conspicuous act of
bravery at the Taku Forts.&nbsp; I lost sight of him for years,
and when I again met him he had left the Army and fallen
apparently on bad times.&nbsp; In consideration of his past
services, he was nominated years later for a Knight of Windsor;
but the poor old fellow was &ldquo;not himself&rdquo; when he
went down to be installed, and the appointment was
cancelled.&nbsp; He was an excellent actor in comic parts, and
has a son, I believe, on the London stage.</p>
<p>The winter of &rsquo;61 was an unusually severe one, and the
river that washed the walls of the grim old Tower was covered
with a thick coating of ice, which in its turn afforded a
convenient asylum for the dead cats and other refuse that drifted
upon it from the neighbourhood of the adjoining wharves.&nbsp;
Locomotion in those pre-Embankment and underground railway days
was not so convenient as now, and as cabs had practically ceased
running by reason of the mountains of snow intervening between
the Tower and the Monument, I had, together with a few boon
companions, decided that the time had come for a migration, and
went in for &ldquo;first leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>And the
choice we had made was by no means an unhappy one, for the
weather that had made existence in London well nigh intolerable
had driven the woodcocks into the coverts, and we all declared
that a week of such surroundings would compensate for all the
vicissitudes we had undergone from Kangaroos, Tower, and five
o&rsquo;clock bacon and eggs in London.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;route,&rdquo; too, had come, and we reasoned, not
unwisely, that the journey to Ireland was at best an unpleasant
one, and that if we delayed, 1000 to 60 were by no means
extravagant odds that we might get no leave at all.</p>
<p>It was about a fortnight after this that, having returned to
grimy old Lane&rsquo;s, I received a characteristic letter from
my old chum, George Hay.&nbsp; &ldquo;Most of my time&rdquo; (he
wrote) &ldquo;is spent in accompanying the old squire on his
various peregrinations over the estate, and by pointing out
various agricultural developments that were absolutely necessary,
or structural alterations that would improve the holdings.&nbsp;
He leads me to understand that my place was on the spot I would
one day inherit, and the fitting moment would arrive after I got
my company.&nbsp; &lsquo;D&mdash; it, sir,&rsquo; he would
continue, &lsquo;in my time no eldest son remained longer than a
year in the army unless he was prepared to pay &pound;10,000 over
regulation for the regiment as Cardigan did.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But in the infantry, sir,&rsquo; I suggested,
&lsquo;things are different.&nbsp; Promotion is slower, and I
can&rsquo;t help thinking that the bonds that unite officers to
the regiment are stronger than is usually the case in the
cavalry.&nbsp; But I see no prospect of my company till we are
under orders for foreign service, and we shan&rsquo;t be at the
top of the roster for another two years at least.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have nothing to say against the line,
sir,&rsquo; he would reply, &lsquo;except that your officers can
rarely ride to hounds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But surely, sir,&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;there
are other <a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>virtues you will not deny to the linesman; in garrison
towns they at all events appreciate hospitality, and don&rsquo;t
insult worthy folks by accepting their invitations only to turn
them into ridicule.&nbsp; You may remember the story of a young
puppy who replied to a kindly hostess by &ldquo;The King&rsquo;s
never dance, and the King&rsquo;s never sing,&rdquo; and this in
a regiment, forsooth, where every man-jack of them was a
shopkeeper&rsquo;s son, and which was known as the &ldquo;Trades
Union.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Great excitement meanwhile prevailed at the Tower; the route
had come, the mess was closed, and everybody was packing in
preparation for an early departure for Ireland.&nbsp; Transports
in those long-ago days were not the floating palaces inaugurated
years later by the Indian troopers.&nbsp; Cranky
steamers&mdash;whose principal industry was the transporting of
pigs and cattle&mdash;were hurriedly chartered by the War Office,
and with the men packed like herrings, and the junior officers
billeted amongst the band instruments, regiments proceeded at
five knots an hour from London to the Irish ports.</p>
<p>The Colonel, during these preparations, lost no opportunity of
describing his experiences when last stationed in Dublin; how he
and certain boon companions were within an ace of being tried for
their lives for throwing into the Liffey an old watchman
deposited in a sentry-box; how they started the &ldquo;Pig and
Whistle&rdquo; in Sackville Street, run on lines that would shock
you, virtuous reader; their nightly visits to the
&ldquo;Quane&rsquo;s&rdquo; Theatre, where Mikey Duff performed
<i>Hamlet</i>, and declined to accede to the demands of the
gallery for &ldquo;Pat Molloy and the roising step&rdquo; with
the indignant retort: &ldquo;D&mdash; yer oise, what do you
expect for toppence;&rdquo; the orgies of &ldquo;Red bank&rdquo;
oysters at Burten Binden&rsquo;s, and the dinners at the Bank of
Ireland, when the regiment furnished the guard; how old Bill,
after a drinking bout, would stamp through every corner of the <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>guard-rooms,
cursing at everything, and winding up by the consumption of
half-a-dozen brandies and sodas, and &ldquo;very different to
what it was in the Peninsula!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Payther&rdquo; Madden, too, was holding forth on what
he would show them in Cark, if &ldquo;plase the Lard the rigimint
was quarthered in the ould station,&rdquo; and went on to
describe how Barny Magee &ldquo;wad come on and sing at the Hole
in the Wall with a gaythaar in his fist, looking for all the
world like a hamstrung moke,&rdquo; and how the gallery would
shout, &ldquo;For the love of dacency, Barny, dhrop yer
concertina and pull up yer stockin&rsquo;,&rdquo; and how Mrs.
Rooney, bless her soul, would pass yer the toime of day with that
grace&mdash;so genteel loike, so obsarvent&mdash;as ye paid toll
to go in, with: &ldquo;God bless you, Carporal, it&rsquo;s you
that has the lip,&rdquo; or ilse: &ldquo;Go an wid ye, Carporal,
for a flirrt that ye are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sort of bloomin&rsquo; sing-song,&rdquo; suggested a
cockney comrade, &ldquo;but give me London, with &rsquo;er
bloomin&rsquo; orange peel and hashfelt, with &rsquo;er boats
down to North Woolwich, with yer gal on yer knee and a new clay
in yer face; a pint of shrimps maybe, and a pint of ale down yer
neck, and no bloomin&rsquo; guards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amid these conflicting sentiments the regiment quitted the
Tower.</p>
<p>And what a delightful station the Dublin of the sixties was;
here Lord Carlisle as Lord-Lieutenant reigned supreme, and though
compelled by usage to keep up the mock court, with its mock
&ldquo;Master of the Horse&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gentlemen at
Large,&rdquo; diffused hospitality like the fine old English
gentleman he was.</p>
<p>Nightly the captain and subaltern of the Castle Guard were
invited to the Viceregal table, during which the kind old man
clinked glasses and invited his every guest to take wine with
him.&nbsp; How His Excellency could retain his head after all
these <a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>courtesies was once a marvel till it transpired that the
huge decanter before him was the weakest brandy and water diluted
to the exact colour of Amontillado.&nbsp; And then the whist that
followed at sixpenny points, when His Excellency rigorously
prevented his partner&mdash;and his partner only&mdash;from
seeing every card in his hand.&nbsp; How refreshing it all
was!</p>
<p>No contortions short of dislocating their necks could prevent
his adversaries from taking advantage of the dishonest
opportunity, for the old gentleman cracked jokes throughout the
entire rubber, and claimed and paid his sixpences with the
scrupulousness of a confirmed gambler.</p>
<p>Among the Viceregal staff were some inflated specimens of
vice-flunkeydom.&nbsp; Foster, Master of Horse, whose death
occurred lately, was reputed as not knowing one end of a horse
from another, and never ventured on a purchase for the Viceregal
stables, at Farrell&rsquo;s or Sewell&rsquo;s, unless fortified
by the close proximity of Andy Ryan or some other
horse-coper.&nbsp; Burke, a Gentleman at Large and an ex-colonel
of militia, was another warrior of the offensive type, and I
shall never forget the scene when a youngster of the 16th Lancers
at one of the lev&eacute;es gave him a peremptory order when he
was officially glued to the staircase, under pretence that he
mistook him for a flunkey.&nbsp; But the matter was not to end
there, and before the r&eacute;veille had ceased blowing at
Island Bridge he was waited upon by a fiery buckeen to demand
satisfaction on behalf of Kornel Burke.</p>
<p>Captain Stackpool (everybody had a military title) was another
Dublin curiosity.&nbsp; Member of Parliament for Ennis, he
affected Dublin and the delights of the Unoited Service from one
year&rsquo;s end to the other.&nbsp; Dublin, he assured me, was
the most &ldquo;car-driving, tea-drinking, money-spending city in
the world,&rdquo; and he was not far wrong.</p>
<p>Lord Louth, who weighed eighteen stone, and stood <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>five foot
seven in his stockings, had served some years in a kilted
regiment; but he, too, has long since been gathered to his
fathers.</p>
<p>About this time an amusing incident occurred to Lord
Louth.&nbsp; The very best of fellows, his vanity was insatiable,
and only London-built clothes were good enough to set off his
graceful figure.</p>
<p>In the 14th Hussars was a diminutive cornet who also
patronised the same tailor as Louth, and both these
dandies&mdash;as appeared later&mdash;had telegraphed on the same
day for a pair of the most bewitching trousers in preparation for
some social event to which they had both been invited.&nbsp;
Conceive the consternation of the two recipients when at the last
moment a pair of diminutive pants revealed themselves to the
enraged peer, and a garment sufficiently voluminous to engulf
three Deal boatmen reached the expectant cornet.&nbsp; This
latter was known as the &ldquo;Shunter&rdquo; from the
extraordinary talents he developed later as a gentleman rider,
and still later as a hanger-on of Abingdon Baird.</p>
<p>One of the most brilliant surgeons that Ireland or any other
country has ever produced was just coming into prominence in
those long-ago days.&nbsp; Dr. Butcher, who in appearance
resembled the portraits of Disraeli in his younger days, was
known professionally to nearly every man in the garrison; of the
most enthusiastic type, he thought nothing of producing two or
three stones from his waistcoat pocket and exultantly explaining
that he had that morning taken them from certain patients&rsquo;
interiors, and nothing gave him greater offence than refusing to
attend one of his private s&eacute;ances.&nbsp; But the most
marvellous operation he ever performed was on Billy Deane, of the
4th Dragoon Guards, who, having consulted every specialist in
Europe, appealed to Butcher to save his arm and enable him to
remain in the service.</p>
<p><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>A fall
whilst hunting had resulted in the disease of the elbow-bone of
the left arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing but taking your arm off will save your
life,&rdquo; was the universal fiat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&mdash; nonsense!&rdquo; was Butcher&rsquo;s retort,
and he cut a square clean out of the elbow.</p>
<p>Within six months Billy&rsquo;s bridle arm was stronger than
the other.</p>

75</span>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE RATCLIFF HIGHWAY.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> months had elapsed since the
regiment landed in Ireland, when one of those inscrutable ways of
Providence gave another opportunity of renewing one&rsquo;s
London experiences, and obtaining a month&rsquo;s leave in the
height of the drill season for the purpose of visiting the
Exhibition of &rsquo;62.&nbsp; The temptation so gratuitously
offered was altogether too much for me, and, in conjunction with
the rest of the Army in Ireland, I gratefully seized the
opportunity of &ldquo;studying&rdquo; the various exhibits of
foreign countries, and applied for leave for that specific
purpose.</p>
<p>Limmer&rsquo;s, where a select band took up its quarters, was
at this time one of the chief resorts of young bloods and
subalterns, for the most part of the cavalry, who revelled in
sanded floors and eating off the most massive of silver.</p>
<p>Entering the coffee room on the afternoon of our arrival, I
was greeted by a cheery voice, and descried Hastings lingering
over his breakfast.&nbsp; Truth to say, his lordship had not a
robust appetite.&nbsp; The mackerel bone fried in gin, and the
caviare on devilled toast remained apparently untouched, whilst a
<i>hors-d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre</i>, known as &ldquo;Fixed
Bayonets&rdquo;&mdash;of which the recipe is happily
lost&mdash;failed to assist his jaded appetite; alongside him
stood a huge tankard of &ldquo;cup,&rdquo; and pouring out a
gobletful for his newly-found chum, and gulping down a pint by
way of introduction, he gasped: <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>&ldquo;By Gad, old man, I&rsquo;m
d&mdash; glad to see you!&nbsp; To begin with, you must dine with
me at 8&mdash;here.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve asked Prince Hohenlohe and
Baron Spaum, and young Beust and Count Adelberg, and if
you&rsquo;ll swear on a sack of bibles not to repeat it, I expect
two live Ambassadors&mdash;it&rsquo;s always as well&rdquo; (he
continued in a confidential tone) &ldquo;to have a sacred person
or two handy in case of a row with the police.&nbsp; First we go
to Endell Street&mdash;to Faultless&rsquo;s pit.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
got a match for a monkey with Hamilton to beat his champion bird,
The Sweep, and after that I&rsquo;ve arranged with a detective to
take us the rounds in the Ratcliff Highway.&nbsp; No dressing,
old man; the kit you came over in is the ticket, and a sovereign
or two in silver distributed amongst your pockets; you&rsquo;re
bound to have a fist in every wrinkle of your person&mdash;why,
if you&rsquo;re dancing with a beauty she&rsquo;ll be going over
you all the time.&nbsp; I often used to laugh and shout out,
&lsquo;Go it, I&rsquo;m not a bit ticklish!&rsquo;&mdash;still,
what the h&mdash; does it matter?&rdquo;&nbsp; And his lordship
sucked down another libation to the gods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you can speak French or German; if not you
can try Irish&mdash;not that it matters, for I expect Fred
Granville and Chuckle Saunders, and Hamilton is sure to bring a
mob, so I think we may count on having the best of it if it comes
to a row.&nbsp; How long are you up for?&nbsp; A month, eh?&nbsp;
Oh, well, then we&rsquo;re right for the Derby, and I&rsquo;ll
tell you what we&rsquo;ll do.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll go down the
evening before&mdash;the night before the big race amongst the
booths is the nearest approach to hell vouchsafed to unhappy
mortals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Punctually to time our party assembled, and it would have been
difficult for the unenlightened to have realised that the
gaitered, flannel-shirted, monkey-jacketed assembly embraced
diplomats, peers, and obscure Army men who have since made their
mark in history.&nbsp; Here might have been seen Charlie <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>Norton, the
youngest and handsomest major in the service, who years after
developed into a Pasha amid the Turkish gendarmerie; Ned
Cunyinghame, in the zenith of his fortune, dilating (with the
dessert) on the superior attributes of Nova Scotia baronets, and
how an ancestor had once told the Regent &ldquo;it was a title he
could neither give nor take away;&rdquo; Count Kilmanseg, the
best whist player that ever came out of Hanover; Prince
Hohenlohe, a charming attach&eacute; just beginning his career;
Baron Spaum, the best of the best, now Commander-in-Chief of the
Austrian Navy, and president of the recent Anglo-Russian
Arbitration in Paris; Count Adelberg, a genial Muscovite, who
considered <i>menus</i> superfluous, and once shocked a very
correct hostess by exclaiming &ldquo;<i>Je prends
tout</i>,&rdquo; and a host of others unnecessary to
enumerate.&nbsp; Presiding at the head of the table was the
genial young Hastings&mdash;not yet a married man&mdash;faced, as
vice-president, by Freddy Granville, whose wavy hair, gentle
manners, and frank and English appearance were boring their way
into the hearts of the best women and men in Society, except,
perhaps, the strict Exeter Hall school.</p>
<p>To approach a cockpit, even in the long-ago sixties, required
a certain amount of discretion, and so it came to pass that the
sporting team broke up into twos and threes, and by a series of
strategical advances by various routes, arrived within a few
minutes of each other at the unpretentious portals in Endell
Street.&nbsp; Descending into the very bowels of the earth, the
party was considerably augmented by his Grace of Hamilton&rsquo;s
contingent, and within half an hour, the spurs having been
adjusted and all preliminaries arranged, the two champions faced
one another in the arena.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later it was a piteous sight to see the brave old
champion Sweep attempting to crow, although he seemed aware he
had received his quietus.</p>
<p><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>Suffice
to say Hastings won the wager, and the party hurried eastward,
leaving the brave old bird like a warrior taking his rest.</p>
<p>One of the most popular pastimes of the long-ago sixties was
going the rounds of the dens of infamy in the East End and the
rookeries that then abutted upon the Gray&rsquo;s Inn Road.&nbsp;
In this latter quarter, indeed, there was one narrow, tortuous
passage that in broad daylight was literally impassable, and to
escape with one&rsquo;s life or one&rsquo;s shirt was as much as
the most sanguine could expect.</p>
<p>The Ratcliff Highway, now St. George&rsquo;s Street East,
alongside the Docks, was a place where crime stalked unmolested,
and to thread its deadly length was a foolhardy act that might
quail the stoutest heart.</p>
<p>Every square yard was occupied by motley groups; drunken
sailors of every nationality in long sea-boots, and deadly knives
at every girdle; drunken women with bloated faces, caressing
their unsavoury admirers, and here and there constables in pairs
by way of moral effect, but powerless&mdash;as they well
knew&mdash;if outrage and free fights commenced in real
earnest.&nbsp; Behind these outworks of lawlessness were dens of
infamy beyond the power of description&mdash;sing-song caves and
dancing-booths, wine bars and opium dens, where all day and all
night Chinamen might be seen in every degree of insensibility
from the noxious fumes.</p>
<p>The detective who was to be our cicerone was known to every
evil-doer in the metropolis.&nbsp; Entering these dens when not
in pursuit of quarry was to him a pilgrimage of absolute safety,
and a friendly nod accompanied by &ldquo;All right, lads, only
some gents to stand you a drink&rdquo; extended the protection to
all who accompanied him.&nbsp; A freemasonry, indeed, appeared to
exist between these conflicting members of society whereby, by
some unwritten code, it was understood <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>that when either side passed its word
every one was on his parole to &ldquo;play the game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first place the explorers entered was a singsong in the
vicinity of Nile Street, but it was evidently an &ldquo;off
night,&rdquo; for, with the exception of a dozen half-drunken men
and women, the place was practically empty.&nbsp; As we entered,
however, a sign of vitality was apparent, and the chairman
announced that a gent would oblige with a stave; but the cicerone
with commendable promptitude called out, &ldquo;Not necessary,
thank you all the same,&rdquo; and prompted his followers to lay
five shillings on the desk.&nbsp; But the compliment was not to
be denied, and a drunken refrain soon filled the air, which was
absolutely inaudible, except:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;She turned up her nose at Bob Simmons and
me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next place was infinitely more interesting&mdash;the
&ldquo;Jolly Sailors,&rdquo; in Ship Alley.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
dozen,&rdquo; explained our cicerone as he tendered a coin, and
our party awaited admission.&nbsp; &ldquo;Keep your money,
sergeant,&rdquo; was the ominous reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course, I
know you; but we&rsquo;ve got a mangy lot here to-night; they
won&rsquo;t cotton to the gents.&nbsp; If they ask any of their
women to dance it will be taken as an affront, and if they
don&rsquo;t ask them it will be taken as an affront; leave well
alone, say I.&nbsp; Most nights it might do, but not to-night,
sergeant; the drink&rsquo;s got hold of most of them, and
there&rsquo;s a lot of scurvy Greeks about who will whip out
their knives afore you can say what&rsquo;s what.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, man,&rdquo; cut in Bobby, &ldquo;we
don&rsquo;t want to have a row, we&rsquo;ve come for a spree;
there&rsquo;s the money, we&rsquo;ll take our
chance.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Baron also, who prided himself on his
mastery of our vernacular, interposed with: &ldquo;Posh, I snaps
my finger at eem!&nbsp; Am I afraid of a tirty Greek?&nbsp;
Posh!&nbsp; All our intent is larks; we want no rows.&nbsp;
Posh!&rdquo; And regardless <a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>of the friendly monition, our party
trooped into the room.&nbsp; The scene that presented itself was
not an encouraging one; perched on a rickety stool was a fiddler
scraping with an energy only to be attained by incessant
application to a mug of Hollands that stood at his elbow, and to
which he appeared to resort frequently.&nbsp; Polkaing in every
grotesque attitude were some twenty couples, the males attired
for the most part in sea-boots and jerseys, their partners with
dishevelled hair and bloated countenances, all more or less under
the influence of gin or beer; here and there couples, apparently
too overcome to continue the giddy joy, were propped against the
wall gurgling out blasphemy and snatches of ribald song, whilst
in alcoves or leaning over a trestle table were knots of men,
smoking, cursing, swilling strong drinks, and casting wicked eyes
at the intruders.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Aven&rsquo;t they a leg of
mutton and currant dumplin&rsquo;s at &rsquo;ome wi&rsquo;out
comin&rsquo; &rsquo;ere?&rdquo; inquired a ferocious
ruffian.&nbsp; &ldquo;What for brings &rsquo;em a-messing about
&rsquo;ere, I&rsquo;d like to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blast me if I wudn&rsquo;t knife &rsquo;em; what say
you, lads?&rdquo; replied a stump-ended figure, stiffening
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bide a while, lads; let&rsquo;s make &rsquo;em show
their colours.&nbsp; What cheer, there?&rdquo; shouted a huge
Scandinavian, as a contingent detaching itself from the main body
lurched towards the explorers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What cheer, my hearties?&rdquo; sang back Hastings,
and, with a diplomacy that might have done credit to a Richelieu,
the entire party were fraternising within a minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Jolly Sailors&rdquo; was admittedly the most
dangerous of all the dens, even amid such hotbeds of iniquity as
&ldquo;The King of Prussia,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Prince
Regent,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Old Mahogany Bar,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Old
Gun,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Blue Anchor,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Rose
and Crown,&rdquo; and had decoys in all directions to lure
drunken sailors or foolish sightseers within its fatal
portals.&nbsp; Situated <a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>at the extremity of Grace&rsquo;s
Alley, it led directly into Wellclose Square, a <i>cul de sac</i>
it was easier to enter than to leave; but sailors of all
nationalities are admittedly the most impressionable of mortals,
and happily in the present case the <i>sang-froid</i>, the
unexpected rejoinder, the devil-may-care bearing, disarmed
apparently their rugged hostile intentions, and within half an
hour visitors and regular customers&mdash;Germans, English,
Scandinavians, and nondescripts&mdash;were shouting:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s old England coming to?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Board of Trade ahoy!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What any of us knew of the Board of Trade or the Mercantile
Marine history does not say.</p>
<p>The opium dens in this delectable quarter were situated higher
up at Shadwell, but the charms of the &ldquo;Jolly Sailors&rdquo;
proving too much for our heroes, they elected to explore no
further.</p>
<p>How different is the entire neighbourhood to-day!&nbsp; The
very name Ratcliff Highway has disappeared, and been replaced by
that of Saint George&rsquo;s Street East; where constables once
patrolled on the <i>qui vive</i> in twos and threes a solitary
embodiment of the law may now be seen, strolling along in a
manner that once would not have been worth an hour&rsquo;s
purchase; where drunken sailors in sea-boots and knives at every
girdle lurched against inoffensive pedestrians, unwashed women
may now be seen at corners knitting stockings, whilst unsavoury
tadpoles are constructing mud-pies in the gutter; here and there
may still be seen an inebriated foreigner and rows of
loafers&mdash;with a striking resemblance to the
&ldquo;unemployed&rdquo; hanging about the public-houses, but the
solitary specimen in blue seems to exercise a salutary
hypnotising effect, all which (justice demands) shall be placed
to the credit of these enlightened days.&nbsp; Not that this
welcome change has been long arrived at; <a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>not four
years ago a respectable tradesman, Abrahams, a naturalist, of
191, St. George&rsquo;s Street East, was attacked at 2 p.m.,
within fifty yards of his own door, and succumbed to his injuries
within twenty-four hours, and even to-day to ostentatiously show
a watch chain passing certain corners, say Artichoke Lane, would
not be without danger; but when all is said and done, there is
much to interest the seeker after novelty by a visit to the
Ratcliff Highway of to-day.&nbsp; Here at the &ldquo;Brown
Bear&rdquo; may now be seen the rooms, once devoted to orgies,
filled to their utmost capacity with canaries sending up songs to
heaven purer far than those of the long-ago sixties.&nbsp;
Continuing along St. George&rsquo;s Street will be found
Jamrach&rsquo;s menagerie, whence filter most of the rarities
that find their way to the Zoological Gardens; and the place is
no ordinary bird shop, but a museum of information in more ways
than one.&nbsp; Here one large room will be found stuffed with
bronzes and curios from all parts of the world, which every
American visiting London, who fancies he is a critic, does not
fail to inspect; for Mr. Jamrach&mdash;like his father&mdash;is
an authority, and a naturalist in the highest acceptation of the
term.</p>
<p>Lovers of animals will not regret a pilgrimage to &ldquo;the
Highway,&rdquo; a pilgrimage which, by the aid of the District
Railway and broad, electric-lighted streets, is no longer
attended with discomfort or danger.</p>

83</span>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE BOOTHS ON EPSOM DOWNS.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">While</span> racing men have gained by the
railway&rsquo;s close proximity to the course, others are now
deprived of many of the sights there used to be seen along the
road.&nbsp; From Westminster Bridge to the historical heath was
almost one continuous panorama of life, joviality, cheer, and
fun; every hedgerow was lined with open-mouthed yokels, gaping at
the &ldquo;coves from Lunnon&rdquo; of whom they had heard so
much, but had never before seen; every ditch supported a natural
artificial cripple; every beerhouse was fronted by holiday crowds
quaffing ale and inviting one to join; and to cap all this, the
miles of vehicles with their accompanying dust gave every one the
complexion of chimney sweeps, despite veil, artificial nose, and
other guises incidental to a real journey by the road.</p>
<p>The party Lord Hastings had organised was a thoroughly
representative one: Fred Granville, Peter Wilkinson, Ginger
Durant, Fred Ellis&mdash;not yet blossomed into Howard de
Walden&mdash;Bobby Shafto, The Baron, Young Broome (on duty), and
a host of smaller fry; all united in one purpose, one
aim&mdash;to enjoy life to its uttermost limit, and to lose not
one fleeting moment of the night preceding the first summer
meeting at Epsom.&nbsp; Booths in those wicked days <i>were</i>
booths, not devoted as now to penny shots with pea rifles and the
excitements permitted by our <a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>prudish legislature, but receptacles
of every conceivable impropriety, to recount many of which would
shock you, virtuous reader.</p>
<p>Here were gipsies of the old original form, who, if permitted
to tell a modest girl her fortune, invariably wound up by
informing her &ldquo;she&rsquo;d be the mother of six,&rdquo;
dancing booths, and tableaux vivants booths; booths where
sparring and booths where drinking might be indulged in freely,
booths where terrible melodramas were given, gambling booths, and
thimble rig booths; roulette and three-card establishments, where
every vice come down from the days of Noah might be indulged in
without let or hindrance.</p>
<p>Leaving Limmer&rsquo;s in the afternoon, and proceeding by
easy stages, we reached the Downs shortly before eight.&nbsp; No
time was lost in commencing business, and within an hour we were
assisting at the erection of a theatre booth, whilst a
&ldquo;fragment&rdquo; here and there was being rehearsed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what does your Lordship think of that?&rdquo;
inquired a perky little man who had known the Marquis as a patron
at a dozen other meetings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid, Simmons,&rdquo; replied his patron;
&ldquo;but why such serious scenes, why not a jolly jig with
sailors; poor Nelson, surely he&rsquo;s out of place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means, my Lord; on the contrary, my audiences
will &rsquo;ave it, and if only Mr. Fuljome would act up to
&rsquo;Ardy&rsquo;s part it would bring down the
&rsquo;ouse.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s this way, my Lord: Nelson says:
&lsquo;&rsquo;Ardy, I&rsquo;m wounded mortually,&rsquo; and then,
of course, &lsquo;&rsquo;Ardy must say melancholy like:
&lsquo;Not mortually, my Lord?&rsquo;&nbsp; But blow me if I can
get it right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&mdash; the drama,&rdquo; replied the kindly
Marquis.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you any one to send for a
drink?&rdquo;&nbsp; And pulling out two or three sovereigns the
party proceeded on their quest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, my Lord,&rdquo; was next shouted from a roulette
booth.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just ready for the swells.&nbsp;
Step in, <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>gentlemen,&rdquo; continued a flash-looking
rascal.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah! Mr. Broome,&rdquo; he added, as he
recognised the ex-puncher, &ldquo;no need for you, I
hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not, Levi,&rdquo; replied the Marquis.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve got some quarrelsome chaps about; best be
prepared.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again we proceeded on our
pilgrimage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the tableaux vivants, Hastings?&rdquo;
inquired Fred Ellis.&nbsp; &ldquo;Damn it, we must show the
Baron.&rdquo;&nbsp; But at this moment an unrehearsed incident
occurred which stopped the future legislator&rsquo;s
eloquence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A word with you, Mr. Wilkinson,&rdquo; said one of a
couple of very shady individuals.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
&rsquo;ave to come wi&rsquo; us,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;a
capias at the suit of Beyfus&mdash;&pound;200 with
costs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang it,&rdquo; replied Peter, with
<i>sang-froid</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you let it stand
over?&nbsp; If you nab me now I can&rsquo;t pay, but if
you&rsquo;ll let me alone till after the meeting I&rsquo;ll make
it right, not only with Beyfus, but with you.&nbsp; Now, look
here, here&rsquo;s how it stands.&nbsp; On Saturday next
I&rsquo;m going down with Lord Hastings to Castle
Donington.&nbsp; Send one of your chaps after me, and about eight
send a letter in to me.&nbsp; We shall be at dinner&mdash;leave
the rest to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the following Saturday, the programme was carried out in
its entirety.&nbsp; Peter Wilkinson was staggered by the
unexpected blow! and the much-abused, kindly Hastings paid the
claim on the spot.</p>
<p>And this is how boon companions requited the most generous man
in England.&nbsp; What wonder, the target of friends and foes,
the deepest well at length dried up!&nbsp; The party meanwhile
had moved on, and Peter on rejoining it found the champagne
flying with a vengeance.&nbsp; The site was a huge marquee, the
audience the entire company that had journeyed from London,
blended with the full strength of the tableaux vivants cast.</p>
<p><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>Fred
Ellis was holding forth in an incoherent speech till, offended by
being told to &ldquo;shut up,&rdquo; he walked out of the
tent.&nbsp; Within ten minutes, shouts of &ldquo;Help! murder,
help!&rdquo; were wafted into the marquee, and groping amid tent
ropes, the cause was not far to seek.</p>
<p>On his knees, in an attitude of supplication, was the
honourable Fred; standing within a yard of him was a huge white
goat.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, go away; don&rsquo;t take me.&nbsp; Oh, I
know he&rsquo;s come for me at last.&nbsp; Oh, take the devil
away, I know it&rsquo;s him, and I swear I&rsquo;ll never touch
wine again.&nbsp; Help! murder!&rdquo;&nbsp; Lanterns meanwhile
approaching from various directions, the position appeared simple
enough.&nbsp; The unhappy man on lurching amid the tent ropes had
unfortunately caught his leg in a harmless goat&rsquo;s tether;
in endeavouring to extricate himself he had dragged the
inoffensive quadruped close to him, and being at the time in a
state (presumedly) unusual for him, the surroundings, grafted on
to a strong religious tendency, had distorted a very ordinary
billy-goat into the devil specially on his track, and standing
over him waiting to waft him to where&mdash;no matter how
thirsty&mdash;drink was absolutely unattainable.&nbsp; Fred Ellis
had once won the Grand Military, but that was before&mdash;</p>
<p>Luncheon on the Derby and Oaks days in the long-forgotten
sixties was an institution that dwarfs the most ambitious
displays of hampers and cold pies consumed on the tops of
drags.&nbsp; Conceive a huge marquee with tables the entire
length groaning under every delicacy, from plovers&rsquo; eggs at
a shilling a-piece to pat&eacute;s and blanc-manges of the Gunter
school of creation.&nbsp; Imagine vats six feet high around the
entire walls distilling the best champagne into goblets filled by
the most expert of footmen.&nbsp; Conceive all this, free,
gratis, and for nothing by simply presenting your card with the
name of your regiment inscribed; behold <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>the genial
host smiling contentedly, as supporting on his arm a live Duchess
of Manchester&mdash;now her Grace of Devonshire&mdash;he
administered to the internal wants of one of the most beautiful
women of the day!</p>
<p>Cynics, not contented with accepting the gifts the gods
provided, were prone to remark that assuming the feast cost Tod
Heatly a thousand, he would gladly have doubled it, if only to
enable his fellow-creatures to feast their eyes on that supreme
moment of his life when he piloted his fair charge across the
crowded course.</p>
<p>Tod Heatly, it may be explained, possessed almost the entire
monopoly of supplying champagne to the various messes of the
Army.&nbsp; Amassing wealth hand over hand by this profitable
connection, he returned the compliment by giving a general
invitation to any officer of any regiment who dealt with his
firm.</p>
<p>Incredible as it may appear, no instance ever occurred of
enterprising chevaliers entering without a right, and the
delightful custom only ceased when the usages of society, the
abolition of purchase, and our advanced ideas made it absolutely
necessary.</p>
<p>A similar experiment in these enlightened days would require
admission by parole and countersign and a squad of constables
within measurable distance.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most unique individual that has ever risen to a
prominent position on the Turf was Captain Machell, whose death
occurred not long since.</p>
<p>Joining the 14th Foot some time in the fifties, he exchanged
as a captain to the 53rd, and, retiring a few years later,
invested his entire fortune&mdash;his commission money&mdash;in a
pitch at Newmarket.&nbsp; It was during his earlier soldiering
days that he had the good fortune to be stationed with the
dep&ocirc;t of his regiment at Templemore, a desolate bog in the
heart of Tipperary, where commanded as clever a judge of a
horse&mdash;Colonel Irwin, of the Connaught Rangers&mdash;as ever
came out of &ldquo;ould Oireland.&rdquo;&nbsp; The permanent
staff <a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>of
dep&ocirc;t battalions in those remote days retained their
appointments indefinitely, a regulation that enabled them to
settle down very cosily, undisturbed by anything more formidable
than an annual inspection conducted on the most comfortable
lines.&nbsp; Needless to add that Templemore was no exception to
the rule.</p>
<p>The drill field adjoining the barracks was converted into a
paddock for brood mares and yearlings; the entire stabling and
any superfluous out-houses became roomy loose boxes; hens
cackled, cocks crowed, and pigs grunted from every point of the
compass, and any youngster prepared to purchase a promising
hunter&mdash;&ldquo;a bit rough, but likely to shape
well&rdquo;&mdash;from the Colonel need perform no more arduous
duties than eating his dinner in uniform and chewing a straw all
day.</p>
<p>This equine elysium continued till young men began to grizzle
and two-year-olds became &ldquo;aged&rdquo;; it might, indeed,
have continued much longer had it not been for the unfortunate
Fenian scare and the military precautions that attended it.&nbsp;
Suffice it to say, that in one single day, and without the
slightest warning, the Commander-in-Chief&mdash;Lord
Strathnairn&mdash;suddenly appeared in the Square, and within
twenty-four hours the happy community was for ever broken up, the
farm produce sent off to various auction rooms, and the battalion
half-way across the Channel.</p>
<p>Machell, when he arrived at the dep&ocirc;t, was not long in
ingratiating himself with the Colonel, and within a year the pair
were joint owners of Leonidas, a chestnut gelding that beat
everything at all the surrounding meetings at Thurles, Cashel,
and Tipperary.</p>
<p>Machell, after his retirement, disappeared below the horizon
till summoned to assist at the pulverisation of the unhappy
Hastings in the spring of &rsquo;67, and it was after that, with
&pound;80,000 to his credit, that he loomed into sporting
publicity.</p>
<p><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>A
splendid judge of a horse, possessed of a wiry frame, an
expressionless face, and a shrewd and calculating temperament,
little wonder that he was more or less associated from &rsquo;67
to his death with every wealthy horse-owner aspiring to a career
and every ass desirous of pilotage by the astutest man of his
day.</p>
<p>Machell as a young man had few equals in all feats requiring
agility; he could hop, apparently without effort, on to the
mantelpiece in the smoking-room at Mackin&rsquo;s Hotel, Dublin;
he could out-run most men for any distance between 100 and 1,000
yards, and as a middle-weight could hold his own amongst the best
of amateur boxers.&nbsp; It was not until years after, when he
came to blows with Bob Hope-Johnstone, at the &ldquo;Old
Ship,&rdquo; Brighton, that the scientific bruiser, hopping round
his colossal opponent, caught a chance blow that felled him like
an ox, breaking three ribs.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here, take this carrion
away,&rdquo; shouted the Major, and the senseless Machell was
removed to his rooms in a cab.</p>
<p>But the redoubtable Bob was, not long after, himself the
victim of a cowardly mauling at the hands of two Bond Street
Hebrews, who since have developed into the highest authorities on
knick-knacks and articles of vertu generally.&nbsp; For even the
rugged major, it would appear, had a weak point near his heart,
and seeking on one occasion a fair seducer at the Argyll, he
traced her to Rose Barton&rsquo;s, and, attacking the two mashers
who were entertaining her, was belaboured with champagne bottles
by the cowardly Israelites, till, bleeding from a score of
gashes, he was removed to the &ldquo;John o&rsquo; Groat&rdquo;
in Rupert Street, a hostelry now known as Challis&rsquo;s, after
a waiter at Webb&rsquo;s Coffee House who aspired to perpetuate
his name.</p>
<p>It is satisfactory to be able to add that in terror of
possible consequences, the brothers paid &pound;200 to their
victim before he attained convalescence&mdash;a <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>circumstance
we have probably to thank for their still being amongst us.</p>
<p>Machell, from the exigencies of his profession, was
unquestionably the ruin of numerous aspiring punters whose
interests clashed with his own.&nbsp; Beaumont Dixie, whose
inclinations tended towards always backing &ldquo;Archer&rsquo;s
mounts,&rdquo; was a notable example, and any one who witnessed
the scene in the paddock after a race where Machell&rsquo;s horse
<i>did not win</i>, will not be likely to forget the ruined
Baronet wringing his hands in despair, and the irate owner
standing over him with &ldquo;Now, Mr. b&mdash; Beaumont Dixie,
I&rsquo;ll teach you to back Archer&rsquo;s mounts.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It will be said by many that Machell was a popular man, that he
was generous, and deserving of every credit for repurchasing an
ancestral estate that was supposed to have once belonged to the
family; others, however, will contend that he was of a selfish
and over-bearing disposition, that his charity was dispensed when
and where it was likely to become known, and that no better or
wiser investment than an estate could have been made by a man
whose capital must have been enormous, and who hoped, by becoming
a landed proprietor, to gain the position seldom attained by a
landless man.&nbsp; Probably Machell was never so good a fellow
as when he was hopping on and off mantelpieces, and when an
accident would have broken his neck and his fortune&mdash;the
value of his commission&mdash;at one blow.</p>
<p>That Machell was born under a lucky star goes without saying,
and is proven by his career from the day he sold out with nothing
but his commission money to his death, when he died worth a
quarter of a million.&nbsp; Popular as a poor man, he every day
became more morose as his pile increased, and his first success
through the introduction of his brother-in-law, Prime (or his
wife), to Lord Calthorpe (for whom he eventually trained), led
him by easy stages <a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>to Mr. Henry Chaplin, Joe Aylesford, and finally to
Harry McCalmont, where all his paths were peace.</p>
<p>His marvellous capacity for &ldquo;out-touting&rdquo; the
touts with which Newmarket was infested was once exemplified
during the trials for the Stewards&rsquo; Cup at Goodwood.&nbsp;
Suddenly dismounting and diving into his pocket he dropped
(apparently) by accident a paper which purported to contain the
weights at which the favourite and others were being tried.&nbsp;
Needless to add, the list had been carefully prepared, and what
if true would have been fatal to the favourite&rsquo;s
performance was, in fact, a highly satisfactory trial.</p>
<p>Within an hour it was reported at the Victoria Club that the
favourite had gone wrong, and 30 and 40 to 1 against him
literally went begging.&nbsp; Two hours later a pre-arranged
telegram reached his agent, and the money that was piled on by
the stable brought a golden harvest at Goodwood.</p>
<p>Doncaster stands out through the long vista of years so
prominently with charms that appealed to every taste that a
reference to the old Assembly Rooms may be pardonable.</p>
<p>Every one who has rambled through the quaint old streets of
Doncaster must have noticed these unpretentious-looking rooms,
which, for aught I know, may still echo during the Leger week
with the blatant babble of the cheap excursion sportsman, but
which in &rsquo;67 were the nightly rendezvous of the various
house-parties, and where Major Mahan, who did most of James
Merry&rsquo;s commissions, was the recognised master of
ceremonies.</p>
<p>In the smaller room on the left as one entered, hazard, fast
and furious, raged pretty well through the night under the
auspices of Atkins, a lank, white-bearded man, who had an
unofficial monopoly at Goodwood and other meetings which no rival
dared to dispute.&nbsp; During the Sussex week he rented a large
house near where the Brighton Aquarium now <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>stands, and
the best of everything was provided gratis.</p>
<p>Old Mahan, who in his youth had been a well-known duellist,
had at this period simmered down to a fiery punter with a shiny
forehead that extended to the nape of his neck, and a grizzly
fringe in the vicinity of his ears.&nbsp; Superstitious to a
degree, if the dice went against him he would seize any youngster
entering the room whose physiognomy looked &ldquo;lucky,&rdquo;
and forcing him into a chair would insist on his calling the
main, and then backing him blindly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t yer
surproised at me losing so incessantly?&rdquo; he once inquired
of Sir Robert Peel, who happened to be standing at his elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; was the caustic answer;
&ldquo;but we all wonder where you get the money to play
with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not that sharpers did not occasionally wriggle in, who, after
the soberer players had left, resorted to reckless measures to
rook the more adventurous spirits, who in the small hours were
more or less tipsy.</p>
<p>An Irish peer (still living) suspecting on one occasion that
the dice were loaded&mdash;as no doubt they were, having been
changed&mdash;and just sober enough to pocket them and leave the
room, was surprised next morning after having them broken, to
find that they were perfectly genuine, and thereupon paid his
losses, which were considerable.&nbsp; It transpired later that
the sharpers, who were staying at the same lodgings (hotels were
not patronised in those days), had entered his room whilst he was
sleeping off the night&rsquo;s debauch and changed the guilty
&ldquo;bones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On another occasion a man with large estates in the Riding who
had sense enough to know he was too drunk to play, and had been
heard to refuse, was considerably astonished next day on the
course at being accosted by a gentlemanly stranger, who,
producing twenty pounds in bank notes, thanked him for his <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>courtesy in
allowing his debt of overnight to stand over, and despite his
protests of having &ldquo;no recollection of the
transaction,&rdquo; was literally forced to accept the money.</p>
<p>Two hours later, however, another stranger approached him and
reminded him of ninety pounds he had won from him overnight, and
again R. R. protested he had no &ldquo;recollection of the
transaction,&rdquo; when a friend passing by chance, the matter
was referred to him.&nbsp; He promptly asserted he was in the
rooms all the evening, and distinctly remembered R. R. refusing
to play; whereupon the sharper, threatening to have satisfaction,
walked away, and neither he nor his twenty-pound colleague was
seen again.</p>
<p>It was surprising the number of Scotsmen that came in those
long-ago days to see the Leger run, and who, night after night
foregathered in the Assembly Rooms for no object apparently but
to drink &ldquo;whusky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come awa, mon, come awa!&rdquo; I once heard an old
Scot insist as he escorted an inebriated countryman out, and from
a discussion that ensued after the delinquent had disappeared I
gleaned that he was an &ldquo;elder,&rdquo; and that
&ldquo;Brother Dalziel was very powerful in prayer.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">RACING PAR EXCELLENCE.</span></h2>
<p>A <span class="smcap">visit</span> I once paid to Castle
Donington had initiated me into many of the mysteries of racing
of which I had hitherto been in profound ignorance.&nbsp; I had
learnt that heavy plungers often deputed minor satellites to bet
according to instructions, and had witnessed
&ldquo;private&rdquo; trials&mdash;which it was well known were
being watched&mdash;where ruses were resorted to that would have
impressed the most sceptical by their realism.&nbsp; I had seen a
&ldquo;favourite&rdquo; pulled up, and within half a minute a
blood-stained pocket-handkerchief hurriedly smuggled into the
rider&rsquo;s pocket; I had witnessed a horse backed for
thousands go lame without apparent cause a week before a race,
and hobble through the village as if on its way to the
knacker&rsquo;s, and I marvelled&mdash;till I gradually became
more enlightened&mdash;at the profound acumen of those in
authority who could bring such invalids to the post in the best
of health and spirits.</p>
<p>I also made the acquaintance of numerous shining lights of the
Turf, some that blazed with universally admitted lustre, and some
that emitted a shady, indescribable glimmer apt to mislead the
wayfarer.</p>
<p>Amongst the former none held a more honourable position, or
was a greater favourite, than Mr. George Payne.&nbsp; A man of
likes and dislikes, he had apparently taken a fancy to me and
often gave me hints that sturdier recipients would have converted
into thousands.</p>
<p><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>Mr.
George Payne, although at this period close upon sixty, was the
centre of every fashionable gathering that met for racing or card
playing; a favourite of the highest in the land, he had come
direct from Norfolk to Nice in company with the chief actor in a
notorious drama enacted many years later, and no man had raised
his voice with greater indignation when, <i>nolens volens</i>, he
found himself in the very centre of the unsavoury vortex,
&ldquo;By &mdash;, sir!&nbsp; By &mdash;, sir!&rdquo;&mdash;an
invariable adjunct&mdash;&ldquo;D&mdash; scoundrel!&rdquo;
dominating considerably amid the numerous <i>pourparlers</i> that
ensued.</p>
<p>As a card player his stakes were simply appalling, and it is a
well-known fact that on one occasion he won &pound;30,000 from
the late Lord Londesborough, who immediately afterwards hurried
off to be married.&nbsp; &pound;100 a game was to him a normal
stake, and any aspirant attempting to &ldquo;cut in&rdquo; at the
table who was not prepared to have an extra hundred on the game
was &ldquo;By &mdash;, sir&rsquo;d!&rdquo; <i>ad infinitum</i>
for depriving a better man of the seat.</p>
<p>Opinions on that remarkable meteor&mdash;Henry Plantagenet
Hastings&mdash;who first came into public notice at the Newmarket
Spring Meeting of &rsquo;62, will always differ.&nbsp; By those
who knew him intimately he will be remembered as a weak, amiable,
and generous youngster, terribly handicapped by a colossal rent
roll, a splendid pedigree, a generous, impulsive disposition, and
an entire ignorance of the value of money.&nbsp; To the present
generation, who have only heard of his escapades, he will appear
as a reckless, unprincipled reprobate, preferring low company to
that of his equals, incapable of restraining his passions in
pursuit of the object of the moment, and sacrificing anything and
anybody for their attainment.&nbsp; Barely had he left Oxford
than he became the target of that sporting world that pursued him
to his grave, and was swindled out of &pound;13,500 for a
&ldquo;screw&rdquo; that ended <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>his days in a cab; after which he
settled down to racing as a serious occupation, and had fifty
horses in training; thence (1862) to 1867 he won the
Cambridgeshire, the Grand Prix, the Goodwood Cup, and a host of
minor races, besides such a colossal sum as close upon
&pound;80,000 on Lecturer in the Cesarewitch of &rsquo;66.</p>
<p>But although the fates had apparently condoned his
infringement of the Tenth Commandment in &rsquo;64, Nemesis was
even then on his track, and it would seem that the colt foaled
about the very time he was exploiting the structural merits of
Vere Street was to be the humble instrument in the hands of
Providence for the ruin of the wicked Marquis.</p>
<p>It is needless here to repeat the threadbare story that once
interested people of how the most beautiful woman of her day
stepped out of a brougham one fine morning at the Oxford Street
entrance to a linen-draper&rsquo;s, and emerged from another door
in the vicinity of Vere Street with the Marquis&rsquo;s boon
companion, Fred Granville.&nbsp; Suffice for our reminiscences,
that if all this had not occurred in &rsquo;64, there would
probably have been no &ldquo;Hermit&rsquo;s year&rdquo; in
&rsquo;67; that Captain Machell would not have commenced his
career by netting &pound;80,000 over the event, and that poor
Hastings would never have lost and paid the 103,000 sovereigns he
did.&nbsp; One cannot follow the ups and downs of this unhappy
sport of Fortune without comparing the cheers that everywhere
greeted him up to &rsquo;67 with the execrations with which he
was assailed by the same rabble at Epsom the following year, and
all because one of the most generous of golden calves had been
tricked and swindled out of a colossal fortune in less than six
years, and had met every obligation till plucked of his last
feather.</p>
<p>Nor can one forget that the yelpings of his indignant judges
(!) were mingled with the hacking cough that carried him to his
grave five months later; yet <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>nobody who saw him drive off the
course would have imagined that the incident had affected him in
the least.&nbsp; &ldquo;I did not show it, did I?&rdquo; he
remarked to an intimate friend almost from his death-bed;
&ldquo;but it fairly broke my heart,&rdquo; and so Henry
Plantagenet Hastings was gathered to his fathers at the early age
of twenty-six, and almost before the howls of the mob had ceased
to ring in one&rsquo;s ears.</p>
<p>Whilst on the fascinating but occult science of racing, the
licence invariably accorded by an indulgent public will not it is
hoped be here withheld if one jumps for a moment into the early
seventies, an era, alas! as far removed from the present
generation as the long-ago sixties.&nbsp; With railway facilities
very different from those of to-day, it was the custom of
&ldquo;bloods&rdquo; to make a week of it at Newmarket during the
great meetings, and so it came to pass that a distinctly
representative party took up their quarters at the residence of
Mr. Postans, the courteous postmaster at Mill Hill, for the Two
Thousand festival of &rsquo;72.</p>
<p>In those long-ago days class distinctions were religiously
observed even in such trifles, and whilst the &ldquo;second
chop&rdquo; resorted to the &ldquo;White Hart&rdquo; and other
comfortable hostelries, the upper crust engaged houses at
fabulous prices, to the advantage of owner and tenant.</p>
<p>The existence was as regular as it was exciting, the racing
being followed by an excellent dinner and a stroll about nine to
&ldquo;The Rooms.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was on the night before the big
race that Forbes-Bentley&mdash;a lucky dog who owned a number of
horses, and who had recently been left a fortune of
&pound;140,000 conditional on his adding a second barrel to his
name&mdash;suggested to a sportsman at dinner that to avoid
notice he should put some money on for him on Prince Charlie for
the Two Thousand.</p>
<p>Beginning his racing career in a pure love of the <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>sport, he
eventually developed into a colossal punter, and
discovered&mdash;it is feared too late&mdash;that the game is not
a paying one.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tommy,&rdquo; he whispered to his
next-door neighbour over their cigars, &ldquo;I want a monkey on
Prince Charlie; will you, like a good fellow, put it on for me
with as little publicity as possible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prince Charlie during the past twenty-four hours had been a
little shaky in the betting, and from being firm at 2 to 1, 5 to
2 was at the moment being laid, and was to be had to any
amount.</p>
<p>Entering the Rooms about midnight the air resounded with
&ldquo;5 to 2 against,&rdquo; as, cautiously approaching the then
leviathan of the Turf, Tommy inquired: &ldquo;What price Prince
Charlie?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lay you 1000 to 400,
Captain,&rdquo; was the reply, and the bet being duly booked, he
continued: &ldquo;And now you can have 3 monkeys to 1 if you
like.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Put it down,&rdquo; replied Tommy, who
although exceeding his commission decided that what was good
enough for Forbes-Bentley was good enough for him.</p>
<p>But barely had he left the bookie when up came T. V. Morgan,
who had a score of horses with Joe Dawson, and inquired what he
had been doing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your horse is not going well in the betting, old
man.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve just taken 3 monkeys to 1,&rdquo; was the
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My &mdash;, there must be something wrong!&rdquo; he
gasped.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go at once to Joe,&rdquo; and
without waiting a moment, he disappeared on his midnight
mission.</p>
<p>Knocking up Joe Dawson, who had long retired to rest, the two
proceeded to the stable, where it was found that the first
favourite&rsquo;s near fore leg was inflamed, with every
indication of a swelling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By &mdash;, Morgan!&rdquo; exclaimed the trainer,
&ldquo;this is d&mdash; serious; the horse has been got at, and
may be again; we mustn&rsquo;t stir from here for the remainder
of the night.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so the two kept vigil alternately
till the saddling bell rang next afternoon.&nbsp; The head <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>stable lad
meanwhile and certain helpers were not admitted into the stable,
and peremptorily discharged in the morning, and bonnie Prince
Charlie won the Two Thousand fairly easily.&nbsp; But during the
race there was a critical moment as the horses entered the Dip
and his jockey was seen to move in the saddle.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
thousand to a carrot against Prince Charlie!&rdquo; was now
shouted by a hundred stentorian voices, but the shouts were
happily short-lived, as the grand old roarer shot out of the
crowd and won with apparent ease.</p>
<p>Joe Dawson and his colleague Morgan meanwhile were inundated
with congratulations, and when Joe recounted the marvellous
escape the good old horse had had, the congratulations were not
unaccompanied by fervent hopes that the delinquents might yet be
discovered and lynched.</p>
<p>On the authority of the late Joe Dawson it may be accepted
that what occurred was of the simplest but most effective nature,
and comes briefly to this: &ldquo;That the fittest horse if
gently tapped with a piece of wood on the back sinew will become
dead lame, and leave no trace of the nobbling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what led to the discovery appears more marvellous.&nbsp;
If Forbes-Bentley had not commissioned Tommy to get his money on,
and if Morgan had not casually asked what he was doing, the fact
of Prince Charlie&rsquo;s unpopularity might never have been
brought home to the former; Joe Dawson might have continued in
his undisturbed slumber, and Prince Charlie at daylight would
have been found to be hopelessly lame.</p>
<p>It was the year in which Aventuriere ran for the Oaks that
George Payne told me that he thought she had a chance of winning,
and a hint of the kind meaning a lot from such a man as Mr.
Payne, I decided to invest &pound;15 in the hopes of landing
&pound;500.&nbsp; Meeting my friend after the race, I expressed
my fear that the mare had not fulfilled his expectations.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Wait <a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>till you&rsquo;ve seen her over a long distance,&rdquo;
was the encouraging reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t repeat what
I&rsquo;m saying, but when the weights are out for the
Cesarewitch get your money back if she carries anything less than
7st.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laying this monition to heart, I decided to trust her for a
big stake, but waiting, alas! to see how Alec Taylor&rsquo;s lot
would be quoted before acting on the hint, I proceeded to
Newmarket with a sporting team.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and dine with me to-night,&rdquo; suggested Fred
Gretton, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t mind meeting Swindells; you
know what he is, but he&rsquo;s d&mdash; amusing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swindells was the owner of the first favourite, The Truth
gelding, a patched-up old crock that had been pulled at every
small meeting for months, and rewarded his enterprising owner by
being given a nice light weight for the Cesarewitch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re both on my &rsquo;orse for
to-morrow,&rdquo; inquired the genial Swindells.&nbsp; And I
explained I had determined to back Aventuriere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s she got on?&rdquo; asked Swindells.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What, 6st. 12lb.?&nbsp; D&mdash; me if any &mdash;
three-year-old has a chance against my &rsquo;orse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was then that I faltered, and, impressed with the
speaker&rsquo;s cuteness, decided to go against my original
intention, and backing The Truth gelding, had the mortification
next day of seeing Aventuriere win by a neck with little Glover
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, got home, I hope?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Payne after
the race, and when I told the truth, he added: &ldquo;Never ask
me for a tip again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was thus that I lost the biggest chance of my life.</p>
<p>But it was before the above blow had descended that Mr.
Swindells was at his best, and during the dinner that we have
referred to told story after story which, however creditable to
his resourceful genius, would by many be considered
&ldquo;fishy.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>&ldquo;Ah, the Chester Cup was the race for getting
money on in those days,&rdquo; remarked the genial
Swindells.&nbsp; &ldquo;I once &rsquo;ad a crock called
Lymington; ah, a rare useful one, too.&nbsp; At the October
Meeting I put &rsquo;im in for an over-night race, the stable lad
up, with orders to pull him up sharp soon after the start, jump
off and wait.&nbsp; The &rsquo;orse was dead lame, of course, and
for why?&nbsp; The lad &rsquo;ad slipped a bit of &rsquo;ard
stuff into his frog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bad case; breakdown,&rsquo; everyone said, so we
took &rsquo;im back to the stables in a van.&nbsp; First the
local vet. saw him, and then a big pot from London, and we
humbugged &rsquo;em both.&nbsp; Not long after I entered
&rsquo;im for the Chester Cup, but told everybody my d&mdash;
fool of a clerk had made a bloomer of it, as the &rsquo;orse
could never be trained, and so when the weights came out he was
chucked in at nix.&nbsp; My eyes! what a cop! and, my Gawd,
didn&rsquo;t he win!&nbsp; Oh, no; only as far as from &rsquo;ere
to nowhere!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Doncaster, too, the hospitalities were even of a more
lavish style, and all the principal owners gave dinner parties
nightly to their various friends.</p>
<p>The name of Sir Robert Peel recalls many episodes in the
career of that most blustering baronet.</p>
<p>Beginning as an attach&eacute; at Berne, the first performance
that brought him into prominence was an outburst of temper at a
local Kursaal, when, seizing the rake, he belaboured an innocent
croupier as the cause of his run of bad luck.</p>
<p>The Foreign Office, deeming change of air desirable, we next
hear of him following the noble sport of racing, when I had the
distinction of coming within the sphere of his amiable
influence.&nbsp; It was in &rsquo;69 that I found myself on one
occasion travelling to Newmarket in the same compartment as Lord
Rosslyn and Sir Robert Peel; in the same train was Lord Rosebery,
making his d&eacute;but as an owner of horses, and still unknown
to fame as the most brilliant of <a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>orators and one of the best Foreign
Secretaries England has ever had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of fellow is young Rosebery?&rdquo; inquired
Lord Rosslyn; to which the most opinionated of men replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks a fool, but I&rsquo;m told he&rsquo;s a bigger
one than he looks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this was the verdict of a man whose claims to celebrity
were based on being the son of a brilliant father, on one who, in
addition to a most successful racing career, is universally
admired as a sound politician, a genial friend, and the most
versatile of living public men.</p>
<p>It was about the same period that the fates again destined me
to be within measurable distance of the over-bearing baronet,
when young Webb, the jockey, had lost a race through no fault of
riding.&nbsp; As he was fuming and abusing the unhappy youth, Mr.
George Payne, who was present, protested against the unjust
charge, adding that although he had lost considerably by the
race, he in no way blamed Webb, who had carried out his
instructions implicitly.</p>
<p>It was at this point one of the most amiable of men
interfered, and laying his hand on George Payne&rsquo;s arm,
said: &ldquo;My dear George, it will take three or four more
crosses to get the cotton out of the Peel family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of a commanding presence, and faultlessly attired in heavy
satin cravat and large-brimmed hat, Sir Robert gave the
impression of patrician down to the heels; it was only&mdash;as
Sir Joseph Hawley suggested&mdash;when the crustation was
tampered with that the plating gave indications of alloy.&nbsp;
Peel was an inveterate gambler, and an admittedly fine whist
player, and even so late as the early eighties might be seen
daily at the Turf Club at the 2 and 10 table, and a pony on the
rub.&nbsp; It was in this most select of establishments that a
fracas occurred between this <a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>most irascible of baronets and a
noble marquis (still living), when the pot called the kettle
black.&nbsp; It ended in both members being suspended, then
mutually apologising, and eventually being restored to the
privileges of the fold.</p>
<p>A bad loser, he was deficient in one quality that makes a
successful gambler, and so remained a failure, despite all the
advantages that political interest gave him.</p>
<p>Of a different type was Sir Joseph Hawley; succeeding to a
huge fortune before he was out of his teens, he went through the
usual finishing school of those days, and served a few months in
the 9th Lancers, after which he devoted his attention to yachting
and visiting the various Mediterranean ports in the vain search
of the pursuit for which nature had intended him.</p>
<p>It was at Corfu, then occupied by a small British garrison,
that he had a unique experience.&nbsp; Entering upon one occasion
the chief bakery of the island, he sought enlightenment on the
process by which the bread was kneaded.&nbsp; Around a vast room,
surrounded by a shelf, sat some half-dozen swarthy naked natives,
whilst here and there lumps of dough were arranged in piles; on
the floor stood two or three youths, whilst suspended from the
ceiling dangled various ropes, which the respective squatters
clutched firmly in their hands.&nbsp; At a given signal, away
they flew, whilst the urchins deftly turned the dough, and then,
with a flop, down came the naked natives, with eyes starting out
of their heads, only again to fly into space, whilst their next
resting-place was being duly adjusted.</p>
<p>No fear of indigestion where such perfect kneading was in
force; indeed, the bread of Corfu bore an excellent reputation,
and the island was considered one of the most popular of Foreign
Stations.</p>
<p>It would be absurd to recount the numerous victories of the
&ldquo;cherry and black&rdquo; colours, although <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>the unique
experience of Blue Gown being disqualified at Doncaster for
carrying &ldquo;over weight&rdquo; in the Champagne Stakes may
come as a surprise to many.</p>
<p>Scotland was represented on the Turf in the sixties by two
shining lights of diametrically different types, the patrician
Earl of Glasgow and the plebeian James Merry (of Glasgow), and
whilst the former, during his fifty years, only once won a
classic race&mdash;the Two Thousand&mdash;the latter swept the
boards of everything over and over again.</p>
<p>Lord Glasgow was not a lovable man; bluff to a degree, and
sensitive as lyddite, the brine that he imbibed in his youth
never appears to have left him, for his lordship was in the Navy
when keel hauling was in vogue, and the sixties found him as
foul-mouthed, irritable, and cross-grained as any British tar
ought to be.</p>
<p>Suffice that in those hard-drinking, hard-swearing days, no
head was harder, no r&eacute;pertoire more complete than that of
this belted Earl (why belted?), who, with all his faults, was a
grand landmark of what a patrician of the old days was, as
surrounded by his boon companions, General Peel, George Payne,
Lord Derby, and Henry Greville, the magnums of claret flowed in
the historical bay-window at White&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But this was
before membership was &ldquo;invited&rdquo; by advertisement.</p>
<p>James Merry, on the other hand, was a typical semi-educated
Scot, game to the backbone, but not up to the standard then
required in a gentleman.&nbsp; He came, indeed, before his time;
had he lived to-day, a baronetcy, or certainly the Victorian
Order, would have been his reward.</p>
<p>It has been the lot of few men to own such horses as
Thormanby, Dundee, Scottish Chief, MacGregor, Sunshine,
Doncaster, and Marie Stuart, and despite the fact that no
suspicion ever rested on James Merry&rsquo;s fair name, it is an
open secret that when MacGregor <a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>was backed for more money than any
Derby favourite before or since, the Ring told him, &ldquo;If he
wins we are broke&rdquo;&mdash;and he did not win.</p>
<p>Devout Presbyterian though he was, he succumbed, alas, on one
occasion, to French blandishments, and ran a horse on the
Sawbath.&nbsp; Summoned by the &ldquo;Elders&rdquo; of Falkirk to
explain the terrible lapse, he freely admitted his sin, and only
obtained absolution by presenting the entire siller to the
Kirk.</p>
<p>But no reference&mdash;however superficial&mdash;to the Turf
in the sixties would be complete without one word of homage to
the great Englishman who did so much for the honour of old
England both in sport and politics.&nbsp; Not that his greatest
admirer can place Lord Palmerston in the front rank either as a
diplomatist or an owner of racehorses, though none can deny him
the marvellous combination of attributes that endeared him to his
countrymen, whether in office or opposition, as when crying
&ldquo;hands off&rdquo; when his prerogative as Prime Minister
was being tampered with; or when leaving a debate to come out and
shake hands with his trainer; or when at Tattersall&rsquo;s
watching the fluctuations in the betting over his hot favourite,
Mainstone, for the Derby; or when twitting his political opponent
(Lord Derby), whom he had just replaced as Prime Minister; or,
again, whilst watching Tom Spring or John Gully punching in the
ring long before any of us were thought of.&nbsp; Ah, there was a
man; an Englishman without guile, and of a type well nigh
extinct!</p>
<p>Lord Palmerston never attained pre-eminence on the Turf, and
when Mainstone&mdash;as was suspected&mdash;was tampered with
before the big race, and when, on a later occasion, Baldwin broke
down in his training, he decided to abandon the sport; what more
noble than the letter he wrote to Lord Naas giving him his
favourite to place at the stud?&nbsp; No auctioneering, no
huckstering&mdash;but a free gift such as only a great Englishman
would have conceived.</p>
<p><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>And
who that frequented the Curragh meetings in the long-ago sixties
has not admired the noble form of this same Lord Naas
(assassinated in &rsquo;72 in the Andaman Islands), accompanied
by those stalwart Irishmen, the late Marquises of Conyngham and
Drogheda?</p>
<p>England must indeed &ldquo;wake up&rdquo;&mdash;to quote a
phrase as old as the hills&mdash;if such records are to be
maintained, and seek&mdash;perhaps in vain&mdash;for other giants
such as these mighty dead, if we are to be what we were in sport
and politics amongst the nations of the earth.</p>
<p>For like the ripples on a placid lake before some great
convulsion of nature, a Cromwell is succeeded by a Charles, and
the Palmerstons make way for less sturdy clay, and then the great
upheaval comes, which ends in chaos, or the prosperity that is
associated with &ldquo;a great calm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether these momentous events will occur, simultaneously with
the establishment of a Duma, and a great penny daily in
Jerusalem, and the abandonment of historical English and Scottish
seats for castles on the Rhine, it would require a modern
Jeremiah to foretell, but the pendulum is oscillating ominously,
with a throb that is not to be mistaken.</p>
<p>Lord Falmouth, whom no earwig ever ventured to associate with
a fishy act, holds the proud distinction of never having backed
his opinion in his life, if we except the threadbare tale that
every biographer sets out as if it were not known to everybody,
of how he once bet sixpence, and paid it in a coin surrounded by
diamonds.</p>
<p>With this attribute universally known, it is perhaps not
difficult to explain the immunity he obtained from innuendo when
his horse Kingcraft won the Derby in the memorable year that the
Ring &ldquo;approached&rdquo; James Merry, despite the fact that
he only ran third to MacGregor in the Two Thousand.</p>
<p><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>That
Lord Falmouth was a successful horse-owner may be accepted by the
&pound;300,000 he undoubtedly won in stakes during the twenty
years of his career; that no one begrudged it him is shown by the
unanimous regret of the racing public when he practically retired
from the Turf, and that even so &ldquo;close&rdquo; a man as Fred
Archer, the jockey, should have subscribed towards a presentation
silver shield speaks volumes for his popularity.</p>
<p>Lord Falmouth, like his grand old naval ancestor, is now a
matter of history, and nothing remains but the two guns outside
the family town house in St. James&rsquo;s Square to remind the
passer-by of two great men, who in their respective spheres were
<i>sans peur et sans reproche</i>.</p>
<p>To Fred Archer, as a phenomenon of a later period, who was
latterly Lord Falmouth&rsquo;s jockey, it is out of the sphere of
these annals of the sixties to refer, but seeing him as I often
have over his usual breakfast of hot castor-oil, black coffee,
and a slice of toast, it seems incredible that he should have
lived even to his thirtieth year.</p>
<p>Constantly &ldquo;wasting&rdquo; to try and attain 8st. 7lb.
his mind and body soon became a wreck, and then the sad end came
by his own hand with which we are all familiar.</p>
<p>Bob Hope-Johnstone and his brother David (&ldquo;Wee
Davy&rdquo;) were two as fine specimens of the genus man as can
well be conceived; but like Napoleon&mdash;who, according to
experts, ought to have died at Waterloo&mdash;Bob outlived the
glory of his youth, and became a morose, cantankerous wretch, who
spent half his time at the hostelry now known as Challis&rsquo;s,
which in the sixties was the resort of every
jockey&mdash;straight or crooked&mdash;that held a licence from
the Jockey Club.</p>
<p>Another shining light about this period was Prince Soltykoff,
whose wife was one of the handsomest women in England.</p>
<p><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>It
was after her death that he came into prominence as an admirer of
beautiful women in general, and of little Graham of the Opera
Comique in particular, and&mdash;later on&mdash;of goodness knows
how many more.&nbsp; Many a time have I seen him at
Mutton&rsquo;s at Brighton, loaded with paper bags full of every
indigestible delight, which the imperious little woman beside him
continued unmercifully to add to.</p>
<p>Lord Glasgow, who was distinguished in the sixties as
possessing the longest string of useless yearlings, was, in
addition to other peculiarities, the most hot-tempered explosive
that epoch produced.&nbsp; Kind of heart in the bluffest of ways,
and throwing money about with a lavish hand, I remember on one
occasion finding myself on the railway station at Edinburgh as
his plethoric lordship was purchasing his ticket.&nbsp; Tendering
a &pound;5 note, the clerk requested him to endorse it, which,
having been done with a churlish air, his temper rose to fever
pitch when the clerk, returning it, said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
ask you where you were going; I want your name, man!&rdquo;&nbsp;
A volley of abuse, in which he was a past-master, then followed,
and the abashed official realised that what he had mistaken for a
grazier was the redoubtable Earl of Glasgow.</p>
<p>The sporting critic of the <i>Morning Post</i>, who wrote
under the name of &ldquo;Parvo,&rdquo; once felt the weight of
his indignation for what, after all, was a fair criticism of the
great man&rsquo;s stud, and when, in &rsquo;69, an obituary
article appeared in the <i>Post</i>, the incident and the exact
wish his lordship had given expression to were conveyed in
flowery symbolism as a hope &ldquo;that he might live to water
his grave, but not with tears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Earl of Aylesford in the sixties was the owner of
Packington Hall, and a princely income, and it was whilst I was
staying with George Graham (owner of the famous Yardley stud
where the great Stirling &ldquo;stood&rdquo;) that a jovial party
drove over from <a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>Packington.&nbsp; Luncheon as served in those days was
an important item in the programme, and long before the
Packington party began to think of returning more than one had
succumbed to the rivers of champagne that flowed.&nbsp; Bob
Villiers (a brother of the then Earl of Jersey) was one of the
first to collapse, and as he disappeared under the table the
kindly host&rsquo;s anxiety was curbed by a shout from Joe
Aylesford, &ldquo;Never mind, George, he&rsquo;s only tried
himself a bit too high.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few years later Joe was one of the party, selected in
company with Beetroot (as Lord Alfred Paget was affectionately
called) and others, to accompany the Prince of Wales to India,
and it was during his absence that the troubles that culminated
in disaster overtook the popular Earl.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
go to India, Joe, if you value your domestic happiness,&rdquo;
was the advice of an old friend, but go he did, and then began
the intrigues of a titled libertine, which ended in strong drinks
and the mortgaging of the ancestral acres.</p>
<p>Amid this genial phalanx no better host was to be found than
old Fred Gretton, and it was apropos of the Cambridgeshire that
the following incident occurred.</p>
<p>Seated round the festive board were some dozen sportsmen,
young men from town and old men from the shires; dear old George
Graham (the breeder of Stirling) and his brother; Duffer Bruce
(father of the late Marquis of Aylesbury), deafer than usual, but
shouting the house down; myself, Peter Wilkinson, and three or
four worthies of the farmer class who had come in the wake of
Fred Gretton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like you to win a large stake,&rdquo;
whispered to me a jolly old squire who had been my neighbour at
dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing would give me greater pleasure,&rdquo; I
replied; &ldquo;the more so as this is positively the last
meeting I am ever likely to be at before going to
Gibraltar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, lad, and why so?&rdquo; persisted my
well-wisher.&nbsp; <a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>&ldquo;I should like you to win a large stake,&rdquo;
and realising that it was now or never, I boldly replied:
&ldquo;Look here, Mr. Bowden, if you can put me on to a good
thing I shall be eternally grateful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ve never heard of Playfair?&rdquo;
inquired Mr. Bowden.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s Fred&rsquo;s horse,
and he&rsquo;s certain to win the Cambridgeshire; he&rsquo;s only
got 6st. 3lb., the acceptances are just out, but, for God&rsquo;s
sake, don&rsquo;t let Fred know.&nbsp; Now, lad, do as I tell
you; I&rsquo;ve taken a liking to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It must be admitted I had never heard of Playfair&mdash;very
few had&mdash;but acting up to the tenets I had learnt during my
two years&rsquo; intimacy with the late Hastings, I boldly took
1,000 to 15 within the hour with the leviathan Steele.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you backing?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Gretton, who
that moment came hurriedly up, and on being informed by the
bookie, he turned to me and whispered into my ear,
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one man could have told you, and
that&rsquo;s that d&mdash; drunken old blackguard Bowden; but not
a word, mind you, you keep to that 1,000.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so the
kind old man toddled off.&nbsp; Shortly before the race, at the
Bath Hotel, Piccadilly, where he always stayed in Town, he
inquired of the two barmaids if they would like a sovereign each
on his horse; and whilst the foolish virgin expressed a
preference for the coin, the wise virgin elected to be
&ldquo;on,&rdquo; and after the race received from the genial
punter &pound;35&mdash;a sum considerably in excess of the
price.</p>
<p>Suffice to say, Playfair won the Cambridgeshire for Mr.
Gretton in &rsquo;72, and it is no exaggeration to add that his
taking to racing to the extent he then did suggested the
idea&mdash;afterwards elaborated&mdash;of turning Bass and Co.
into a limited liability company.</p>

111</span>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE EPIDEMIC OF CARDS.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Commander-in-Chief in Ireland,
at the time of which I am writing, was as crotchety a specimen of
the old school as the Peninsular had ever turned out.&nbsp; Clean
shaved, with a Waterloo expression of countenance, Sir George
Browne was about the last of Wellington&rsquo;s veterans who held
a high command.&nbsp; Despotic and vindictive if thwarted, he had
a squabble with the railway companies, and retaliated by vetoing
henceforth the transit of troops by rail, and a regiment ordered
from Londonderry to Cork did the entire distance by route
march.&nbsp; Not that the ordeal was without its advantages, for
it enabled British regiments to form their own opinions of Irish
hospitality and the numerous good qualities of that
much-misunderstood race.&nbsp; Proceeding in detachments of two
and three companies, every night found them billeted in the towns
or villages through which they passed, and it was no rare
occurrence for the landed proprietors to ride out and insist that
every officer should stay at the Manor House, and to send
supplies of comforts wherewith to regale the men.</p>
<p>Mr. Kavanagh, M.P. for Kilkenny, was a brilliant specimen of a
real old Irish gentleman, and though deformed from his birth,
could hold his own amongst the best.&nbsp; Without arms, this
grand sportsman could ride, drive four horses, and shoot to
perfection, <a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>and his prowess in Corfu and other distant sporting
haunts is remembered to this day.</p>
<p>Riding out to welcome the regiment, no refusal was listened
to, and within an hour every officer was comfortably settled at
Borris Castle, and the men fared proportionately as well.</p>
<p>But the monotony of these tedious pilgrimages will not bear
narration.&nbsp; Suffice it that having landed at Cork we
received orders, much to our delight, to proceed direct to Dublin
instead of to dismal Templemore.</p>
<p>The craze for punting that we had experienced in London
seemed, indeed, to have crossed the Channel, and when the
officers had severally been elected honorary members, it was
found that the Hibernian United Service Club was the hotbed of
about the highest play they had yet encountered.&nbsp; Nightly,
with the precision of a chronometer, ten o&rsquo;clock found the
spacious card room crammed to its uttermost limits, and Irish
banknotes, varying from one to ten sovereigns in value, were
literally stacked a foot high on either side of the table.&nbsp;
All through the night these terrible duels continued, and it was
no uncommon thing to leave the room and drive like blazes for
morning parade at ten.&nbsp; The garrison in this memorable year
was an exceptionally &ldquo;high-play&rdquo; one, consisting,
amongst others, of the 4th and 11th Hussars, 9th Lancers, the
Royal Dragoons, Highlanders, and Rifle Brigade, and during that
winter fabulous sums were lost by men incapable of meeting their
obligations.</p>
<p>The Committee, meanwhile, were roused to action, and
peremptory orders were given that the gas was to be turned off
punctually at 2 a.m.; but the extinction of the gas was the
signal for the appearance of substitutes, and out of some two
hundred pockets wax candles were brought forth, and the game
proceeded as vigorously as ever.</p>
<p><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>Further pressure was now applied, and under pain of
expulsion members were ordered to quit the card room at the
prescribed hour; but even this did not meet the case, and the
punters ascended <i>en bloc</i> to the largest bedroom above.</p>
<p>It may be explained that this really delightful club possessed
a dozen bedrooms, and on the particular occasion of which we are
writing, one was in the occupation of Sir James Jackson, G.C.B.,
as irritable an old Peninsular veteran as a merciful Providence
had spared to the sixties.&nbsp; A cavalry man of the old school,
he invariably wore spurs, and no human eye had ever seen him
without these useful appendages&mdash;a small blue moustache
carefully waxed, and a bald head with blue tufts on either side
completed the picture of this irritable old warrior who ate his
dinner every day in the club, and never spoke to a soul.</p>
<p>Play, meanwhile, was proceeding apace, with calls of
&ldquo;King,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fifty more wanted this side,&rdquo;
&ldquo;D&mdash; it, blaze away,&rdquo; &ldquo;The pool&rsquo;s
made,&rdquo; gracefully interspersed, when the door suddenly
opened, and an apparition in flowing dressing-gown, nightcap,
slippers, and spurs demanded peremptorily that the game should
cease.&nbsp; To refuse the colonel-in-chief of the Carabineers
would, of course, have been impossible, and as the old warrior
retired to his couch the punters left the club.</p>
<p>Ruin, meanwhile, had overtaken many an irreproachable man, and
L&mdash;, of the Royals, K&mdash; of the Rifle Brigade, and a
score of others, had no alternative but to send in their papers,
and then the Commander-in-Chief came upon the scene, and swore,
as only a Waterloo veteran could, that if any officer again
transgressed he would send the regiment to the worst station
between Hell and Halifax.</p>
<p>But the wave of punting that appeared to have engulfed the
land was by no means confined to the <a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>Arlington, Raleigh, and Hibernian
Clubs, and the &ldquo;Rag,&rdquo; and later on the Whist
Club&mdash;known as the &ldquo;Shirt Shop&rdquo;&mdash;caught the
infection, and fabulous sums were wagered on the turn of a card
night after night without intermission.</p>
<p>Two-pound points to &pound;10 on the rubber were the staple
stakes of even the sober old Whist, and then one was looked upon
as depriving a better man of the seat unless prepared to bet an
extra hundred.&nbsp; Old fogies, who had never previously risked
a shilling, would cautiously creep to the table, and nervously
tender half-crowns, till frightened out of their lives by Tony
Fawcett, of the 9th Lancers, shouting, &ldquo;D&mdash; it, sir,
this isn&rsquo;t a silver hell!&rdquo; and then, not to be
beaten, they would club together and make up the requisite
sovereign.</p>
<p>Gus Anson, V.C., M.P., the most popular man of the day, was so
impregnated with the epidemic that although at the time piloting
an important Bill through Parliament, he had given me a standing
order that as soon as a sufficient number were assembled for loo
or baccarat, a telegram was to be despatched to him forthwith,
and numerous were the messages that found their way to the sacred
precincts of the House between ten and twelve at night, addressed
to Colonel the Honourable Augustus Anson, V.C., M.P., presumedly
from constituents.</p>
<p>Brighton, too, suffered from the epidemic, and during the
Sussex fortnight the fever spread to an alarming extent.&nbsp;
The London detachments came down <i>en bloc</i>, and all the best
houses and leading hotels were filled with roysterers, and high
play was the rule from night till morning.</p>
<p>Progress along the King&rsquo;s Road after dusk was a matter
of difficulty, and at every lamp-post one was importuned by eager
touters, and invitation cards thrust into one&rsquo;s hand to
visit this house or that.&nbsp; Every roof sheltered punters of a
lower strata anxious <a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>to emulate their betters, and the
family knick-knacks and the family Bible, left exposed by their
worthy owner in his desire to participate in the golden harvest,
might have been seen huddled together in a corner, or
intermingled with cards, whisky bottles, and tumblers.</p>
<p>In preparation for the nightly orgies that commenced about
ten, the bloods inaugurated a delightful system whereby the
maximum of fresh air with the minimum of exertion might be
obtained prior to the inhaling of the foul currents amid which
they proposed to revel for the rest of the night.</p>
<p>To meet the requirements of the case, every wheelchair was
bespoken or engaged for the entire week at a considerable advance
in price, and a procession, usually headed by George Chetwynd,
Billy Milner and Billy Call&mdash;to whom the honour of the
inception is credited&mdash;might nightly be seen wending its way
to the end of the pier, selecting the most suitable parts, and
generally inconveniencing everybody not of the &ldquo;inner
circle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The costume <i>de rigueur</i> on these progresses was white
tie, evening trousers and vest, and silk hat, with the oldest
shooting coat in one&rsquo;s wardrobe.</p>
<p>Later in the season some Hebrews of imitative dispositions
aspired to emulate the bloods, but although their get-ups were
irreproachable, the fraud was detected, and the jackdaws
ruthlessly suppressed.</p>
<p>It is painful to remember the numerous edifices that toppled,
and the many good men that &ldquo;went under&rdquo; in the
inevitable crash that ensued, and picturing in one&rsquo;s mind
the huge table and the fifteen or twenty players that congregated
nightly around the board in the various clubs&mdash;winners and
losers and lookers-on&mdash;a lump rises in one&rsquo;s throat as
one remembers how few are left!&nbsp; Carlyon and Augustus
Webster, Jauncey, Cootie Hutchinson, Sam Bachelor, Lord Milltown,
Crock Vansittart, La Touche, Hastings, <a

Tom Naghten, Sir George O&rsquo;Donnel, Dick Clayton, Gus Anson,
Freddy Granville, George Lawrence, Jimmy Jop, Jim Coleman, and a
host of others, all good men and true, and all long since swept
away into the inevitable dust-bin.</p>
<p>Not to have known Jinks was not in itself a reproach, but not
to have known Jonas Hunt in the long-ago sixties was to have
admitted that one was without the pale of Society, or certainly
that section of it which gambled, raced, and drank all day and
all night, if circumstances permitted.&nbsp; A fine horseman of
iron nerve and unbounded assurance, he had ridden in the
Balaclava charge before he was out of his teens, and on retiring
from the service a few years later, developed into one of the
best gentleman riders ever seen in England or France.</p>
<p>In a chronic state of impecuniosity&mdash;as he insisted on
asserting&mdash;he never omitted to add that a good knife and
fork was always ready at home.&nbsp; Jonas had certainly run
through pretty well all he had had, but still he always possessed
an income.</p>
<p>Always ready to gamble, and always cheery, Jonas, as may be
supposed, was popular with a certain set, and if he had a fault
it was a forgetfulness in regard to the settlement of small
scores, which by some was attributed to the excitement when he
rode in the &ldquo;six hundred,&rdquo; and by others to various
causes not sufficiently interesting to enumerate.&nbsp; Brave as
a lion, he had actually been recommended for the Victoria
Cross&mdash;in those days less lavishly awarded than
now&mdash;and as he was quite ready to &ldquo;go out&rdquo; on
the slightest provocation, timid natures preferred to put up with
eccentricities arising out of his forgetfulness rather than risk
a daylight meeting at twelve yards rise.</p>
<p>Whilst riding in France his performances were a revelation to
his foreign critics, and when on one occasion his bridle broke
and he steered his mount <a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>to victory with his whip, he
received such an ovation at Chantilly as seldom falls to the lot
of a perfidious Briton.</p>
<p>On one occasion, Jonas, who had allowed a comparative stranger
to leave the table without settling, was met by the indignant
creditor a few days later and reminded of his obligation; but
Jonas, in no way disconcerted, let the amazed punter understand
that such a demand was highly ungentlemanly and insulting,
offering as an alternative to retire with him forthwith and fight
it out with either pistols or fists.</p>
<p>In the duel between Dillon, a gentleman rider, and the Duc de
Grammont-Caderousse, which created such an unjust scandal in the
sixties, Jonas, as might have been expected, was the
former&rsquo;s second.&nbsp; Neither man had ever had a rapier in
his hand before, and when on the following morning both began
slashing and thrusting, and Dillon was run through the heart, a
clamour arose as to the butchery of an Englishman by an expert
swordsman; all which was bosh.&nbsp; Had de Grammont been
anything but the veriest tyro, the regrettable incident could not
have occurred.</p>
<p>It was subsequent to the various thrilling incidents we have
narrated that Jonas selected Brighton as his headquarters.</p>
<p>Jinks&rsquo; Club was not located in a palatial mansion, nor
did it even present the modest exterior of the local Union Club;
as a fact, it was limited in its dimensions, and consisted of two
rooms in an unpretentious house in Ship Street.</p>
<p>In the front room was a long table and some two dozen chairs,
an iron safe, and a side table, convenient for the support of
such light refreshments as sandwiches, hard-boiled eggs, and
beverages of a popular kind.</p>
<p>The back room was more or less a sealed subject, and supposed
to contain club memoranda, Jinks&rsquo; <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>books, and
to be the spot where the &ldquo;proprietor&rdquo; carried on the
business.</p>
<p>Membership of the club was within the reach of all, and a
&ldquo;quorum&rdquo; of Jinks and Jonas could on emergency elect
a member without general meeting or ballot; but those specially
introduced by Jonas were received with marked favour.&nbsp; Nor
were there apparently any fixed rules as to meetings, which were
left to circumstances, and an urgent three-lined whip on
emergency.</p>
<p>The procedure in the latter case may briefly be described as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>If Jonas met a &ldquo;likely&rdquo; man&mdash;from
town&mdash;he would tell him that his appearance was the luckiest
thing in the world, as that very night a rare round game was
&ldquo;coming off,&rdquo; that baccarat would begin at nine, and
that the rendezvous was Jinks&rsquo; Club.&nbsp; This point being
settled, an urgent whip was sent round by the indefatigable
Jonas, and by 8.45 a representative company awaited the desirable
plunger from town.</p>
<p>Prior to the commencement of the game, Jonas, it must be
conceded, was a mass of energy.&nbsp; Attired in evening clothes
he would first unlock the mysterious safe, and after the local
members had come one by one, presumably to deposit money, and
returned with counters conspicuously displayed, he would turn
with his most winning smile to the visitor with: &ldquo;Now, old
man, how much do you want to buy; it saves a lot of bother by
having counters?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve only to plank your counters
after it&rsquo;s over, and get their value; good rule,
don&rsquo;t you think?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s what they do at &lsquo;le
Cercle&rsquo; at Nice; saves a lot of bother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Occasionally, during the excitement of the game, strangers had
been known to put into the pool brand new crisp notes to save the
bother of buying counters; but these were always exchanged for
counters by the ever-obliging Jonas.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s much
better to have one <a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>sort of settlement, don&rsquo;t you think, old
man?&rdquo; he would add, as stuffing the notes into his pockets
he eagerly rushed into the fray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove! it&rsquo;s later than I thought,&rdquo; was
often a familiar exclamation as daylight appeared over the
pier.&nbsp; &ldquo;How many counters have you got, Jack?&nbsp;
Count them, old man, or keep them till morning.&nbsp; You and I
are old pals; you know where to come in the morning.&nbsp; Name
your own hour; good-night.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the genius was round
the corner like a hurricane.</p>
<p>An amusing incident once occurred where Jonas was a big
winner, and his debtor Master Fred Granville; Jonas on this
occasion was immeasurably chaffed.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
never get a bob,&rdquo; he was told right and left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes I will, he&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; was the
half-hearted reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s going away in the morning,&rdquo; added
another; &ldquo;you must look sharp, Jonas.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
Jonas intimated he had been promised that a cheque should be sent
him in the morning.</p>
<p>Next morning a cab drove rapidly to the Norfolk, and Jonas,
jumping out excitedly, said: &ldquo;Look here, you chaps,&rdquo;
and he waved a cheque excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a look at it,&rdquo; asked Ernest
Neville.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, man, it isn&rsquo;t
signed.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Jonas&rsquo;s face lengthened
inordinately as he realised the terrible omission.</p>
<p>Shouting for a cab after a hurried glance at a railway guide,
he in due time reached the station, and had the satisfaction of
seeing the last carriage slowly receding from view.</p>
<p>It was the winter that Garcia&mdash;a Spanish
miscreant&mdash;who had won colossal sums at every hell in
Europe, had just been detected in a trick that had long baffled
the ingenuity of the world.</p>
<p>The scheme was nothing less than procuring the contract for
the supply of cards at the principal <a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>gambling resorts of Nice, Monaco,
St. Petersburg, Homburg, Paris, and Ostend.</p>
<p>Shiploads of his ware thus found their way into every quarter,
and wherever he played he was confronted by his own cards.&nbsp;
Knowing their backs as well as their faces, the result was
obvious, and it was only after innumerable golden harvests that a
clumsy accident brought the fraud to light in a salon in the
Champs-Elys&eacute;es.</p>
<p>The scare thus created had not been lost upon the Riviera, and
every precaution that ingenuity could devise was taken to make
foul play impossible.</p>
<p>It was during this winter, too, that the culprit, detected
cheating at the Raleigh, put an end to his career.</p>
<p>Le Cercle de la M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e is one of those
majestic buildings that meets the enormous revenue required for
its support by making the pastime of cards an absolute
luxury.&nbsp; On the first floor is a spacious saloon, with no
better light than that afforded by plate-glass panels
communicating with the card room and other chambers; liberally
provided with lounges, weary punters resorted to it for repose,
and waiters, when not otherwise occupied, hovered near it as
within easy call of everywhere.&nbsp; In the adjoining room cards
were usually set for possible whist and ecart&eacute;, or until
every available spot was required for the more exciting claims of
chemin de fer.</p>
<p>Biscoe had on more than one occasion rambled through the empty
room, and oblivious of the proximity of the servants, had been
seen pocketing a pack of cards.&nbsp; This having been duly
reported, he was made an especial object of interest to the
committee; though, until he essayed to play, it was looked upon
as the act of a kleptomaniac.</p>
<p>All this, however, was unknown to the culprit, who, with but
one object, one aim in life, laughed at every reverse, and raked
in his winnings when Fortune <a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>smiled on him.&nbsp; His luck as a
whole had been fairly good, and thinking the moment a favourable
one, he decided to increase his stakes.</p>
<p>It was now his deal, the &ldquo;chemin de fer&rdquo; was with
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, gentlemen, let us plunge,&rdquo; he
jokingly remarked, as, producing a pocket-book, he placed it upon
the pack.&nbsp; &ldquo;I call twenty-five thousand
francs.&rdquo;&nbsp; (&pound;1,000).</p>
<p>A keen observer might have detected certain ominous glances
that passed between the polite Count and the bland Professor, but
nothing was said, and amid the silence of the Catacombs, the game
proceeded.</p>
<p>Five minutes later Biscoe was raking in &pound;1,000 (in
counters).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again, gentlemen!&rdquo; he shouted, as flushed and
excited, he had not observed that two or three players had risen,
and the remainder, bewildered at so unusual a proceeding, stared
at one another in blank astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; inquired Biscoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&mdash;d if I know,&rdquo; was the laconic reply, as
an Englishman left the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Committee, sir,&rdquo; replied the Count,
&ldquo;have decided to count the cards, and on their authority I
take possession of those before you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile groups discussed the position and ominous
expressions, such as &ldquo;Il nous faut un agent de
police,&rdquo; and &ldquo;C&rsquo;est clair que nous avons
&eacute;t&eacute; vol&eacute;s&rdquo; were bandied about.&nbsp; A
<i>proc&egrave;s verbal</i> also took place, presided over by the
Duc de Richelieu, and within an hour it was known to every
<i>gamin</i> in Nice that an English &ldquo;milor&rdquo; had
descended to the level of a thimble-rigger, that his spurs had
been hacked off by the fiat of public opinion, and that
henceforth his place would know him no more.</p>
<p>The rest is briefly told.&nbsp; A dozen extra cards were found
in the packs that had been correct before play commenced; the
counters in Biscoe&rsquo;s possession were <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span><i>not</i>
redeemed by the club, and the &ldquo;acceptance&rdquo; was as far
from redemption as ever.</p>
<p>Next morning, as the gardeners were sweeping the grounds, a
dead body with a gun-shot wound in the head was found in a
shrubbery.</p>
<p>Within a few yards lay the tideless Mediterranean, calm and
sparkling as the morning sun played upon its waters; whilst here
lay an upturned face, cold and rigid and ghastly white save for a
clotted disfigurement on the brow, and the same sun, in all the
irony of its grandeur, was lighting up all that was left of
blighted hopes, fallen greatness, and a tragedy never to be
forgotten.&nbsp; Later on, the mangled remains were buried at the
expense of the Municipality.</p>
<p>A week or two later a paragraph appeared in a Dublin paper,
and there the matter ended.</p>
<p>This is the usual procedure in these fashionable
resorts.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;ve lost your last penny you are
provided with railway fare and seen off the premises; if you blow
out your brains, you&rsquo;re buried out of sight.&nbsp; Decency
must be maintained!&nbsp; <i>Faites vos jeux, messieurs</i>!</p>
<p>A convenient custom obtained at Le Cercle de la
M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e whereby a player temporarily cleaned
out was permitted to deposit a pencil on the table to represent a
stake, it being understood that he immediately proceeded to the
bureau to purchase counters to redeem his symbolical
investment.&nbsp; This was known as &ldquo;au crayon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was on one occasion that Bob Villiers, who was usually
limited as regards capital, was seen to place his pencil on the
table and address the courteous dealer with, &ldquo;Cent louis au
crayon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Gad,&rdquo; whispered George Payne, who stood near
me, &ldquo;Bob Villiers has put up a hundred louis &lsquo;au
crayon,&rsquo;&rdquo; and it was in breathless anxiety, and with
an eventual sigh of relief, that we saw him rake up his
winnings.</p>
<p><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>It
was some years later, whilst once standing on the steps of the
H&ocirc;tel des Anglais at Nice, at a time when the one topic of
conversation was the terrible scandal that had lately taken place
in Le Cercle de la M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e, that George Payne
expounded the irrefutable axiom that there were only two offences
that might not be indulged in with impunity, and yet how
extraordinary it was that men of wealth with every enjoyment
capable of gratification should yet founder on one or other of
these two unspeakable rocks, and instanced the recent H&mdash;
affair, where the brother of a peer and major of a crack regiment
had resorted to one of the unpardonable offences.&nbsp; And then
he quoted George Russell, who had married a duke&rsquo;s
daughter, and Lord de Ros and Lord Arthur Pelham-Clinton, another
ducal branch, all of whom, in a species of insanity, had fallen
from their high estates.</p>
<p>Many will recall the weird rumours that floated around the
Clinton case; how the culprit had died and been duly buried; how
weeks later an old gun-room companion had recognised his former
ship-mate in a railway compartment, and how subsequent inquiry
revealed the fact of a coffin filled with lumber.</p>
<p>And in the H&mdash; affair the surroundings were, if possible,
more dramatic; how a youngster of the 7th, at Nice at the time,
at once wrote the story to a brother officer in order that
&ldquo;the first intimation to &lsquo;the Regiment&rsquo; might
not come from the papers;&rdquo; how the recipient intercepted
the commanding officer (Colonel Hale) in the barrack square, and
handed him the letter with: &ldquo;This, sir, I have just
received, and I feel it&rsquo;s my duty to show it to you&rdquo;;
how within a week the pen was ruthlessly run through the
culprit&rsquo;s name, and the nine days&rsquo; wonder was
forgotten.</p>
<p>That the publicity had been far-reaching, the following from
the Paris <i>Figaro</i> will show:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One had hoped that chevaliers of industry were <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>things of
the past, but it is not so; the game goes on as ever, to judge of
what occurred last Monday at le Cercle de la
M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e&mdash;a place where one always
imagined one only met persons with whom one&rsquo;s purse would
be safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was last Monday that an amiable
personage&mdash;whose assumed manners suggested
imbecility&mdash;carried on a system with cards which has no
connection with honesty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever since yesterday Major H&mdash; has been the object
of a stringent surveillance, called into existence by the
extraordinary fortune of having &lsquo;passed&rsquo; only
seventeen times on Sunday last during a game of chemin de
fer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suspicion was all the stronger from the cards when
counted being found to exceed the proper number by
twenty-seven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was under these circumstances that the Major bought
the bank at auction last Monday, and lost the first two
coups.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was evidently sowing to reap, for after the second
coup, not having sufficient on the table to pay the winners, and
while still holding the cards in his left hand, he drew with his
right hand a note case from his pocket under which were a certain
number of packed cards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He then placed the case and the packed cards on the
pack he had already in his left hand, and putting the entire
packet before him, deliberately opened his note case, whence
protruded several notes that had evidently been exposed with
intention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this moment a member who had not lost a single
detail of this scene of &lsquo;prestidigitation,&rsquo; stood up
and said: &lsquo;Gentlemen, I play no longer, and if you take my
advice you will do the same!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The warning was not in vain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was accepted by all but one player, who placed on
the table about sixty Louis.</p>
<p><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>&ldquo;The Major H&mdash;, in no way disconcerted,
again dealt, and turned up nine&mdash;a nine of diamonds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no further room for doubt, and all the
players left their seats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The game was suspended, the cards were counted; there
were twenty-seven too many; and contained five nines of diamonds
instead of four.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Immediately the committee was called together, and the
expulsion of Major H&mdash; was unanimously decided upon.&nbsp;
It was also decided that the Major should be turned out of the
room he had occupied in the club for two days.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
approve entirely the decision of the committee, but regret that
these Major H&mdash;s get off with expulsion, when the proper
place would be the <i>correctionnelle</i>.</p>
<p>No more liberal player ever existed than George Hay.</p>
<p>On one occasion at a humdrum station in India, where he had
started an unpretentious club, a sporting tailor who had lost
considerably begged him to continue.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give me my
revenge,&rdquo; he implored, and for three days and three nights,
with periodical adjournments for a tub, this amiable punter
continued giving the revenge.&nbsp; But Fate, alas! was against
the little Snipper, and on the third day the score showed a
colossal sum against him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This can&rsquo;t go on,&rdquo; pleaded George.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, man, I shall be placed under arrest for absence
without leave; besides which, I can&rsquo;t keep my eyes
open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one more chance,&rdquo; whined the tailor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied George, &ldquo;you owe
me&rdquo; (and he named a considerable sum).&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll play you one game double or quits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tailor pondered for some moments, and then replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Captain Hay, I have a wife and four
children, and I can&rsquo;t afford to go &lsquo;sudden
death,&rsquo; but I&rsquo;ll play you the best out of three,
double or quits.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>Failing to catch the subtlety of this logic, George
consented, and the result was again against the tailor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said this noble punter, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
complied with all your requests.&nbsp; Nature won&rsquo;t permit
me to continue, but I&rsquo;ll tell you what I <i>will</i>
do,&rdquo; and ringing the bell, he ordered the waiter to bring
in the list of members.</p>
<p>Scanning the names and counting the number, he again addressed
the tailor:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here.&nbsp; We have, I see, fifty-four members;
but old Crutchley and the Chaplain needn&rsquo;t count.&nbsp; You
shall make every member of the club a black velvet knickerbocker
suit with scarlet hose, and a cap, and henceforth we are
quits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prudes and strict sticklers for propriety may argue that the
man was a gambler, and consequently heartless and good for
nothing; but after events proved that although dire calamity
overtook him, he was of a noble, generous nature.</p>
<p>Despite the above incident, the Pindee Club played a very
strict game, and every member before sitting down carefully
adjusted a pair of green spectacles.</p>
<h2><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE COUP DE JARNAC.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> importance of the following
subject&mdash;as many a fool has found to his cost&mdash;entitles
it to a chapter to itself.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s short, but
instructive.</p>
<p>Card-sharping&mdash;pure and simple&mdash;is such a low and
contemptible subject that we would not presume to present it to
our readers were it not occasionally reduced to a &ldquo;fine
art,&rdquo; and, as such, worthy of notice, like the infallible
formula that was in vogue in Europe some years ago, and, for
aught we know, may still be practised by the
&ldquo;past-masters&rdquo; of the fraternity.</p>
<p>One may dismiss with contempt such fumblers as the scion of a
ducal house who staked and lost his social position some years
ago in a high-class Pall Mall club by what has been described as
one of the two unpardonable offences against society; and were it
not for the unique way his clumsy attempt was accidentally
discovered the story would not bear repetition.</p>
<p>There had been a Court function, and Lord Sydney, the Lord
Chamberlain, innocently watching a rubber, was considerably
surprised by a card cannoning against his silk stockings and
striking him on the calf.&nbsp; Whether the fumbler had selected
this course of throwing away a card because he had a bad hand,
and so claiming a mis-deal, or was supplied with a relay like an
amateur conjurer, suffice that he was detected and henceforth
disappeared below the horizon.</p>
<p><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>Nor
will we detail how Prince Sapieha, of the 5th Dragoon Guards,
playing &eacute;cart&eacute; with a subaltern of Lancers, at the
Raleigh, caught his adversary in the act of passing the king, and
so cut short a promising military career, for although Sapieha,
in his generosity, promised not to disclose it, conditionally on
the culprit never again presuming to play at the club, the story
leaked out, and the inevitable result followed.</p>
<p>Nor will we discuss the questionable taste&mdash;considering
the company&mdash;that permitted publicity to the silly tactics
of an impecunious Baronet who, by moving a bone counter,
endeavoured to realise a few ill-gotten sovereigns.</p>
<p>But what we propose to do is to place before our readers a
formula so capable of expansion, so incapable of detection, that
one is staggered at the misplaced ingenuity that discovered the
combination.</p>
<p>Nor do we here refer to the public casinos of France and Monte
Carlo, where at worst one is playing against about 2&frac12; per
cent. above the odds at roulette, and about 1&frac34; per cent.
at <i>trente et quarante</i>, but to those accursed private
parties in Paris, and possibly nearer home, where the following
was in full blast many years ago.</p>
<p>Assuming, then, that we have not all experienced a plucking,
the procedure at (say) baccarat may be given.</p>
<p>Conceive a long oblong table; in the centre sits the banker,
whilst before him are two or three packs of new cards from which
he tears the wrappers, shuffles them, and, placing them on the
table, invites a player to cut.&nbsp; What fairer than
this?&nbsp; What possibility of sharp practice when every eye is
riveted on him, who, dealing one card to the right and one to the
left, finally deals to himself?</p>
<p>Now study the following table, and realise that the wrappers
have been previously steamed and then re-gummed, and that the
cards have been packed <a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>in rotation (face upwards) reading
from left to right:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">7 0 5 9 0 2 6 0 4 1 3 6 0</p>
<p style="text-align: center">8 0 1 2 6 9 0 8 7 0 9 7 0</p>
<p style="text-align: center">4 9 0 2 5 0 4 8 0 3 2 0 8</p>
<p style="text-align: center">1 1 3 5 5 3 4 0 0 0 6 0 7</p>
<p style="text-align: center">(0 represents tens and court
cards.)</p>
<p>Cut the cards as often as you please, and the sequence and
<i>consequence</i> remain unimpaired; before testing this,
however, it must be understood that we refer to experienced
players who know when to draw and when to stand, and it will be
found that the dealer never loses, but for decency occasionally
ties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lightning shuffling,&rdquo; whereby the <i>artiste</i>
(!) appears to dislocate every card whilst really disturbing none
is added to complete the illusion.</p>
<p>Here, then, is a problem worthy of such Solons and
&ldquo;system-mongers&rdquo; as Messrs. Wells, Rosslyn, and
others, who, having found disciples, are invariably in pawn
within a week.</p>
<p>There is, however, one system one should invariably follow:
avoid play, as a <i>private</i> enterprise, however alluring the
surroundings, unless you are perfectly confident&mdash;and how
can one be?&mdash;that the gentleman who takes the bank and his
familiars have not been educated up to the &ldquo;Coup de
Jarnac.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE PUBLIC HANGING OF THE
PIRATES.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the sixties
&ldquo;hangings&rdquo; were done in public, and anything of an
unusual kind attracted large parties from the West End; this was
as recognised a custom as the more modern fashion of making up a
party to go to the Boat Race or to share a <i>coup&eacute;</i> on
a long railway journey.</p>
<p>And so it came about that the phenomenal sight of the
execution of the seven <i>Flowery Land</i> pirates in &rsquo;64
created, in morbid circles, a stir rarely equalled before or
since.&nbsp; Members of the Raleigh, as may be supposed, mustered
in considerable numbers, and days before the fatal morning trusty
agents had visited the houses that face Newgate Gaol and secured
every window that gave an unobstructed view of the ghastly
ceremony.</p>
<p>The prices paid were enormous, varying from twenty to fifty
guineas a window, in accordance with the superiority of the
perspective from &ldquo;find to finish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rendezvous was fixed for 10 p.m. on Sunday at the Raleigh,
but as it was raining in torrents it was a question with many
whether to face the elements, or content themselves with a
graphic description in the next day&rsquo;s papers.&nbsp; But the
sight of three or four cabs, a couple of servants, and a
plentiful supply of provender decided the question, and the
procession started on its dismal journey.</p>
<p>Cursing the elements, the sightseers little knew in what good
stead the downpour served them, and <a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>with nothing worse than being
drenched to the skin the party arrived safely.</p>
<p>A cab-load of young Guardsmen, however, preferring to wait
till the storm abated, never got beyond Newgate Lane&mdash;where
they were politely invited to descend, and, after being stripped
to their shirts, were asked where the cabman should drive them
to.</p>
<p>The scene on the night preceding a public execution afforded a
study of the dark side of nature not to be obtained under any
other circumstances.</p>
<p>Here was to be seen the lowest scum of London densely packed
together as far as the eye could reach, and estimated by <i>The
Times</i> at not less than 200,000.&nbsp; Across the entire front
of Newgate heavy barricades of stout timber traversed the streets
in every direction, erected as a precaution against the pressure
of the crowd, but which answered a purpose not wholly anticipated
by the authorities.</p>
<p>As the crowd increased, so wholesale highway robberies were of
more frequent occurrence; and victims in the hands of some two or
three desperate ruffians were as far from help as though divided
by a continent from the battalions of police surrounding the
scaffold.</p>
<p>The scene that met one&rsquo;s view on pulling up the windows
and looking out on the black night and its still blacker
accompaniments baffles description.&nbsp; A surging mass, with
here and there a flickering torch, rolled and roared before one;
above this weird scene arose the voices of men and women
shouting, singing, blaspheming, and, as the night advanced and
the liquid gained firmer mastery, it seemed as if hell had
delivered up its victims.&nbsp; To approach the window was a
matter of danger; volleys of mud immediately saluted one,
accompanied by more blaspheming and shouts of defiance.&nbsp; It
was difficult to believe one was in the centre of a civilised
capital that vaunted its religion, and yet meted out justice in
such a form.</p>
<p><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>The
first step towards the morning&rsquo;s work was the appearance of
workmen about 4 a.m.; this was immediately followed by a rumbling
sound, and one realised that the scaffold was being dragged
round.&nbsp; A grim, square, box-like apparatus was now
distinctly visible, as it slowly backed against the
&ldquo;debtors&rsquo; door.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lights now flickered
about the scaffold&mdash;the workmen fixing the cross-beams and
uprights.&nbsp; Every stroke of the hammer must have vibrated
through the condemned cells, and warned the wakeful occupants
that their time was nearly come.&nbsp; These cells were situated
at the corner nearest Holborn, and passed by thousands daily, who
little knew how much misery that bleak white wall divided them
from.&nbsp; Gradually as the day dawned the scene became more
animated, and battalions of police surrounded the scaffold.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a little unpretending door was gently opened; this
was the &ldquo;debtors&rsquo; door,&rdquo; and led direct through
the kitchen on to the scaffold.&nbsp; The kitchen on these
occasions was turned into a temporary mausoleum and draped with
tawdry black hangings, which concealed the pots and pans, and
produced an effect supposed to be more in keeping with the solemn
occasion.&nbsp; From the window opposite everything was visible
inside the kitchen and on the scaffold, but to the surging mass
in the streets below this bird&rsquo;s-eye view was denied.</p>
<p>Presently an old and decrepit man made his appearance, and
cautiously &ldquo;tested&rdquo; the drop; but a foolish impulse
of curiosity leading him to peep over the drapery, a yell of
execration saluted him.&nbsp; This was Calcraft, the hangman,
hoary-headed, tottering, and utterly past his usefulness for the
work.</p>
<p>The tolling of St. Sepulchre&rsquo;s bell about 7.30 a.m.
announced the approach of the hour of execution; meanwhile a
steady rain was falling, though without diminishing the
ever-increasing crowd.&nbsp; As far as the <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>eye could
reach was a sea of human faces.&nbsp; Roofs, windows,
church-rails, and empty vans&mdash;all were pressed into service,
and tightly packed with human beings eager to catch a glimpse of
seven fellow-creatures on the last stage of life&rsquo;s
journey.&nbsp; The rain by this time had made the drop slippery,
and necessitated precautions on behalf of the living if not of
those appointed to die, so sand was thrown over a portion, not of
the drop (that would have been superfluous), but on the side, the
only portion that was not to give way.&nbsp; It was suggestive of
the pitfalls used for trapping wild beasts&mdash;a few twigs and
a handful of earth, with a gaping chasm below.&nbsp; Here,
however, all was reversed; there was no need to resort to such a
subterfuge to deceive the chief actors who were to expiate their
crime with all the publicity that a humane Government could
devise.&nbsp; The sand was for the benefit of the
&ldquo;ordinary,&rdquo; the minister of religion, who was to
offer dying consolation at 8 a.m., and breakfast at 9.</p>
<p>The procession now appeared, winding its way through the
kitchen, and in the centre of the group walked a sickly,
cadaverous mob securely pinioned, and literally as white as
marble.&nbsp; As they reached the platform a halt was necessary
as each was placed one by one immediately under the hanging
chains.&nbsp; At the end of these chains were hooks which were
eventually attached to the hemp round the neck of each
wretch.&nbsp; The concluding ceremonies did not take long,
considering how feeble the aged hangman was.&nbsp; A white cap
was first placed over every face, then the ankles were strapped
together, and finally the fatal noose was put round every neck,
and the end attached to the hooks.&nbsp; One fancies one can see
Calcraft now laying the &ldquo;slack&rdquo; of the rope that was
to give the fall lightly on the doomed men&rsquo;s shoulders so
as to preclude the possibility of a hitch, and then stepping on
tiptoe down the steps and disappearing below.&nbsp; At this
moment a hideous <i>contretemps</i> occurred, <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>and one
poor wretch fell fainting, almost into the arms of the
officiating priest.</p>
<p>The reprieve was, however, momentary, and, placed on a chair,
the inanimate mass of humanity awaited the supreme moment in
merciful ignorance.&nbsp; The silence was now awful.&nbsp; One
felt one&rsquo;s heart literally in one&rsquo;s mouth, and found
oneself involuntarily saying, &ldquo;They could be saved
yet&mdash;yet&mdash;yet,&rdquo; and then a thud that vibrated
through the street announced that the pirates were launched into
eternity.&nbsp; One&rsquo;s eyes were glued to the spot, and,
fascinated by the awful sight, not a detail escaped one.&nbsp;
Calcraft, meanwhile, apparently not satisfied with his handiwork,
seized hold of one poor wretch&rsquo;s feet, and pressing on them
for some seconds with all his weight, passed from one to another
with hideous composure.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the white caps were
getting tighter and tighter, until they looked ready to burst,
and a faint blue speck that had almost immediately appeared on
the carotid artery gradually became more livid, till it assumed
the appearance of a huge black bruise.&nbsp; Death, I should say,
must have been instantaneous, for hardly a vibration occurred,
and the only movement that was visible was that from the
gradually-stretching ropes as the bodies kept slowly swinging
round and round.&nbsp; The hanging of the body for an hour
constituted part of the sentence, an interval that was not lost
upon the multitude below.&nbsp; The drunken again took up their
ribald songs, conspicuous amongst which was one that had done
duty pretty well through the night, and ended with</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Calcraft, Calcraft, he&rsquo;s the
man,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but the pickpockets and highwaymen reaped the greatest
benefit.&nbsp; It can hardly be credited that respectable old
City men on their way to business&mdash;with watch-chains and
scarf-pins in clean white shirt-fronts, and with unmistakable
signs of having spent the <a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>night in bed&mdash;should have had
the foolhardiness to venture into such a crowd; but they were
there in dozens.&nbsp; They had not long to wait for the reward
of their temerity.&nbsp; Gangs of ruffians at once surrounded
them, and whilst one held them by each arm, another was rifling
their pockets.&nbsp; Watches, chains and scarf-pins passed from
hand to hand with the rapidity of an eel; meanwhile their piteous
shouts of &ldquo;Murder!&rdquo; &ldquo;Help!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Police!&rdquo; were utterly unavailing.&nbsp; The barriers
were doing their duty too well, and the hundreds of constables
within a few yards were perfectly powerless to get through the
living rampart.</p>
<p>Whilst these incidents were going on 9 o&rsquo;clock was
gradually approaching, the hour when the bodies were to be cut
down.&nbsp; As the dismal clock of St. Sepulchre&rsquo;s chimed
out the hour Calcraft, rubbing his lips, again appeared, and,
producing a clasp knife, proceeded to hug the various bodies in
rotation with one arm whilst with the other he severed the
several ropes.&nbsp; It required two slashes of the feeble old
arm to complete this final ceremony, and then the heads fell with
a flop on the old man&rsquo;s breast, who staggering under the
weight, proceeded to jam them into shells.</p>
<p>And then the &ldquo;debtors&rsquo; door&rdquo; closed till
again required for a similar tragedy, the crowd dispersed, and
the sightseers sought their beds to dream of the horrors of the
past twelve hours.</p>
<p>After the trapeze performance we have just read of, given by
the venerable Calcraft to a delighted audience in front of
Newgate Gaol, it appears to have dawned upon the &ldquo;Hanging
Committee&rdquo; of the Home Office that, although much of the
solemnity of the &ldquo;painful&rdquo; performance would be lost
by the removal of the patriarchal beard, counter advantages might
be attained by the substitution of a younger man to fill the
Crown appointment so popular amongst the masses.&nbsp; <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>A new era
was thenceforth inaugurated.&nbsp; Instead of the length of the
drop being left to the discretion of the <i>artiste</i>, the
exact measurement was not only fixed, but the rope itself
supplied by the Hanging Committee, after a careful calculation by
dynamics of the height and weight of the principal
performer.&nbsp; But the immediate successor of the venerable
Calcraft was found wanting in certain material qualifications,
and although admittedly an expert operator, had a habit of
talking when under the genial influence of stimulants.</p>
<p>An unrehearsed incident, when the head rolled off at a private
execution, thus got into the papers, and it became apparent that
a combination of expertness and reticence was the desideratum to
be sought and found.</p>
<p>It was thus that the hero we are discussing came upon the
scene some few years later.</p>
<p>Marwood allowed nothing to interfere with business, and he
would as soon have hanged his grandmother&mdash;if duly
instructed&mdash;as the most brutal ruffian that ever passed
through his hands.&nbsp; To arrive over-night with a modest
carpet-bag and be up betimes the following morning were to him
matters of routine; to truss his subject with a kicking strap 6
in. wide and then drop into the procession with a face like a
chief mourner&rsquo;s were to him sheer formalities; to give
evidence later in the day before an enlightened but inquisitive
coroner&rsquo;s jury was to him a matter of courteous obligation;
and to step into the street half an hour afterwards with the same
bag&mdash;but with evidently less hemp in it&mdash;all came to
him as part of a routine to be henceforth cast from memory till
the service of his country again demanded his undivided and best
attention.</p>
<p>Any one looking at the retiring little man, dressed in the
most funereal of clothes, clutching a pint pot with his long and
nervous fingers, would have found <a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>it difficult to associate him with
anything more formidable than a bagman hawking samples for
&ldquo;the firm,&rdquo; and it was only when a sort of intimacy
had been struck up and a certain quantity of swipes had been
consumed that, yielding to pressure, the great man launched out
upon his unique experiences.</p>
<p>Marwood&rsquo;s invariable resort was the Green Dragon in
Fleet Street, and so certain as a malefactor met his doom at
eight so certain was the hangman to be found at twelve in the
&ldquo;select&rdquo; section of the pub.&nbsp; This peculiarity,
of course, by degrees got to be known, and so it came to pass
that young bloods with a thirst for knowledge resorted thither,
and &ldquo;hanging days&rdquo; raised the &ldquo;takings&rdquo;
of the fortunate house in Fleet Street.</p>
<p>Incredible as it may appear, this morbid craving is by no
means confined to a few, and large sums used to be paid by
reckless young scamps thirty years ago to assist at these ghastly
functions.&nbsp; It is an undeniable fact, moreover, that a
baronet still alive posed as the hangman&rsquo;s assistant at
numerous executions.</p>
<p>But with the reaction that came as regards public hangings,
the stringency connected with the private performances made these
hobbies impossible, and the present era may take credit for
having advanced considerably in this respect on the usages of the
long-ago sixties.</p>
<p>Before quitting this dislocating subject, it may interest the
student of ancient days to know that where now stands an imposing
public-house, next St. Giles&rsquo;s Church, Bloomsbury, was once
the Beer House where every cart freighted with living victims
from Newgate to Tyburn pulled up for their &ldquo;last
drink.&rdquo;&nbsp; After which, wending their way along Oxford
Road (Street), they alighted at Tyburn Tree, now the garden of 1,
Connaught Place, opposite the Marble Arch.</p>
<p>Surely no passer-by can walk under the porch of <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>Gilbey&rsquo;s offices in Oxford Street without
shuddering at the many sad scenes that ancient portico and that
ancient street have witnessed.</p>
<p>It was beneath it that De Quincey nightly waited for poor Anne
when both were on the verge of starvation; and it was there that
he poured out his lamentations of the stony-hearted
stepmother&mdash;Oxford Street.</p>
<p>The same miseries exist in the present day, and every night
bundles of human rags lie huddled together under its inhospitable
shelter; whilst within, the old Pantheon&mdash;delight of our
childhood when it was a huge bazaar&mdash;blazes with electric
light as the headquarters of a certain whisky which,
advertisements tell us, may be procured of 3,000 agents.</p>
<p>The trial and execution of M&uuml;ller in &rsquo;64 for the
murder of Mr. Briggs in one of the tunnels on the Brighton
Railway, created more universal excitement than anything before
or since, except, perhaps, the case of Mrs. Maybrick.&nbsp; On
the night before his execution, the German Ambassador was
closeted with the Home Secretary at the urgent request of his
Government, and petitions innumerable were presented; but the
Home Secretary was a firm man, and the culprit was duly hanged
next morning in front of Newgate.&nbsp; Personally, I was
sceptical of his guilt, and so interested was I that I obtained
an order to visit Newgate, and by the judicious expenditure of a
shilling, peeped through the observation hole of the condemned
cell; later on I saw him hanged, and it was only on his
confession to the Lutheran minister, just before the bolt was
drawn, that I admitted the justice of the sentence.&nbsp; But the
fair-haired Saxon youth of refined and prepossessing appearance
had got on my nerves, and when, a week later, his effigy was
advertised as having been added to Tussaud&rsquo;s Wax-works, I
determined to again see the youth, whom I had last seen being
jerked into eternity.</p>
<p><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>In
those days the exhibition was in the Baker Street Bazaar, and if
the premises were not as roomy as the present palatial building,
they certainly appeared to me &ldquo;snugger.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Chamber of Horrors was snugness itself.</p>
<p>It was whilst exploring this dismal chamber that an attendant
told me that wax figures were the most improvident creatures in
the world; that they ran their toes through their stockings with
reckless unconcern, and that two or three people were constantly
employed darning and mending the belongings of these weird
beings.</p>
<p>As I left the building I pondered over what I had seen and
heard, and soon discovered I had not heard the last of
M&uuml;ller yet.&nbsp; This is what I saw, or fancied I saw, in
my dreams:</p>
<p>As I entered the Chamber of Horrors a few nights after,
M&uuml;ller&mdash;whose pose is of the meekest and most
becoming&mdash;suddenly shot out his arm, and, pointing at me,
exclaimed in a loud and guttural voice: &ldquo;Seize him, seize
him; the man!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then Rush and Greenacre and a host of
others yelled and execrated me, and Mrs. Manning (whose crime was
probably the cruellest on record) shrieked like a curlew:
&ldquo;Seize him, seize him!&rdquo;&nbsp; On this I dropped my
umbrella&mdash;a weakness that I trust will be deemed
pardonable&mdash;under the circumstances&mdash;and immediately
followed it with a terrific flop on the floor; so terrific,
indeed, was it that it brought me to my senses, and I awoke in a
cold perspiration in Jermyn Street.</p>

140</span>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE HOSTELRIES OF THE SIXTIES.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Long&rsquo;s</span> Hotel, in Bond Street,
as it appeared in the sixties, was a species of adjunct to half
the clubs in London.&nbsp; Men playing till three or four in the
morning in clubs that aspired to being considered
&ldquo;correct&rdquo; usually adjourned to Long&rsquo;s, and one
man having engaged a bedroom, the rest trooped in after
him.&nbsp; To such an extent, indeed, was this recognised, that a
commodious bedroom on the ground floor was especially set apart
for these nocturnal emergencies, and within five minutes of
entering the most methodical of night porters produced cards,
candles, and the inevitable brandy and sodas.&nbsp; Here play of
a very high order frequently took place, and here also drunken
rows and card disputes often ensued, unrestrained by the
unwritten sanctity of a high-class club.&nbsp; It was here that a
well-known baronet&mdash;long since dead&mdash;had a barging
match with a peer still above the horizon, but rarely visible to
the naked eye, where, after strong language, blows were
exchanged, and a meeting arranged across the Channel, which
happily never came off, the belligerents agreeing, after calm
reflection, that dirty linen was best washed at home, as their
respective laundry baskets were considerably overfreighted as it
was and needed no further handicapping in the way of publicity;
it was here that a young ass&mdash;still living&mdash;paid
&pound;4,000 <a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>for a broken-down ex-Derby horse that would have been
dear at &pound;100.</p>
<p>It was here that poor old Jim Stewart&mdash;seldom sober, and
long since dead&mdash;gave a baccarat party to some twenty
plungers, where it was agreed that no deal should commence after
6 a.m., at which hour he was the winner of &pound;1,500, and
where, yielding to the earnest request of a heavy loser, he
consented to extend the time to 6.30, and rose a loser of
&pound;5,000; it was here that the fastest and best men in London
lounged in and out of the coffee room from breakfast time till
well on in the afternoon, and smoked, drank champagne, talked
horsy, and swore loudly.</p>
<p>Not that Long&rsquo;s was not a highly-respectable hotel; on
the contrary, the entire upper part was conducted on strictly
correct lines, and patronised by the best county people of the
day, and the latitude granted to the ground floor must be set
down rather as a desire of the management to please all parties,
and bow before the inevitable there was no resisting.</p>
<p>An amusing story may here be introduced of Colonel Oakes, of
the 12th Lancers, the most irascible of cavalry officers, with a
command of language that few, if any, could excel, and who
invariably put up at Long&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Stationed at Aldershot, the Colonel about this time got
married, and, anxious to avoid publicity, he decided to bring his
bride up to London and, to make matters still less noticeable, to
bring his soldier-servant with him.</p>
<p>Things went happily till the faithful attendant, who was an
Irishman, knowing the Colonel&rsquo;s impatient nature, and
considering the luggage was a long time coming up, put his head
over the banisters and shouted: &ldquo;Will you be plased to
bring up the Colonel&rsquo;s and Miss Black&rsquo;s
boxes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tableau half an hour later in the Colonel&rsquo;s
apartments may reasonably be left to the reader&rsquo;s <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>imagination: the politest of landlords expressing his
astonishment, the most irritable of Dragoons cursing his
impudence, and the innocent cause of this comedy of errors
trembling for the consequences.</p>
<p>Colonel Oakes was admittedly a good soldier, and second only
to Valentine Baker as a cavalry leader; popular with both
officers and men, he was one of the last of the old swaggering
school, a man of likes and dislikes, who, although free and easy
and very plain-spoken, was a martinet in other ways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;R&mdash;,&rdquo; he once said to one of his officers
(who certainly was not the accepted ideal of a sabreur), after an
inspection, &ldquo;the General asked me if you had come from the
infantry,&rdquo; and when the remark failed to elicit the reply
he desired, he continued: &ldquo;D&mdash; it, sir, you spoil the
look of my regiment.&nbsp; I wish to &mdash; you&rsquo;d
exchange!&rdquo; and when the culprit lost his temper and said he
considered he was insulted, and that he was the son of a baronet,
the irresponsible Colonel shouted: &ldquo;D&mdash; it, sir,
I&rsquo;m the son of a shoemaker, and I wish to &mdash;
you&rsquo;d leave my regiment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On another occasion, strolling into the stables, he overheard
two recruits discussing him: &ldquo;I say, Bill,&rdquo; remarked
one of the warriors, &ldquo;the Colonel&rsquo;s a d&mdash; rum
old buffer.&rdquo;&nbsp; To which the other acquiescing, the
Colonel advanced, and standing before the trembling culprits,
began: &ldquo;Yes, I heard what you said&mdash;that I was a
d&mdash; rum old buffer&mdash;and I tell you what it is; if you
had drunk as much as I have in the last thirty years you&rsquo;d
be a d&mdash; rum old buffer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite all these circumstances, no smarter regiment existed
than the 12th in the long-ago sixties, although it was commanded
by a &ldquo;d&mdash; rum old buffer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack Peyton, who commanded the 7th Dragoon Guards, was another
patron of Long&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Shortly after his second marriage
with a wealthy widow, <a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>his boon companion, Tom Phillips, of
the 18th, asked him, &ldquo;Is she good-looking,
Jack?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, by &mdash;, Tom,&rdquo; was the
reply, &ldquo;d&mdash; near as ugly as yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fashion of dining at restaurants had not taken root in
those days, and the feeding resorts were few and good and very
far between.</p>
<p>Their numbers, indeed, were to be counted on one&rsquo;s
fingers, and were resorted to either for lunch or supper, and
seldom, as now, for the more serious ceremony of dinner.</p>
<p>People dined at their hotels, for the plate-glass abominations
that now cumber the ground at every point of vantage had not
suggested themselves to undesirable aliens and our own home-grown
Israelites.</p>
<p>When the (present) Berkeley Hotel first started the new idea
under the auspices of the renowned Soyer, the separate-table
system was a nine days&rsquo; wonder, and people were impressed
when it was currently reported that Lady Blantyre and her most
unimaginative of husbands might be seen nightly at the next table
to Skittle&rsquo;s enjoying the creations of that most marvellous
of chefs.</p>
<p>It was here that that distinguished siren once rebuked a
waiter who had clumsily splashed her with some viand, by:
&ldquo;You infernal lout, if I wasn&rsquo;t a lady I&rsquo;d
smack your ugly face!&rdquo; and it was at St. James&rsquo;s (as
it was then called) she was nightly entertained by her numerous
worshippers.</p>
<p>A noble marquis&mdash;eventually a duke, and lately
deceased&mdash;was for years supposed to be her lawful husband,
but the devotion of a life-time and subsequent events have since
given the lie to this evident <i>canard</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Guildhall Tavern,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Albion,&rdquo;
and Simpson&rsquo;s long reigned supreme as places where saddles
and sirloins, marrow-bones and welsh rabbits were to be obtained
in perfection; but all have now disappeared, except in name, nor
will the expenditure of <a name="page144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>fortunes in their resurrection ever
bring back the indescribable air of solid comfort that
characterised these hostelries of the Sixties.</p>
<p>It was in the last-named house, even then on the wane, that my
solitary (active) interest in the drama afforded me numerous
occasions of delight.</p>
<p>Off the entrance hall was an unpretentious room, and here
every day for weeks a divine being from the Gaiety partook of a
hurried lunch in the company of my enraptured self.</p>
<p>Nothing could have been more decorous than the tone that
pervaded our frugal meal; nothing so incapable of giving offence
to Exeter Hall opposite; the door of our retreat was
intentionally kept ajar, yet despite these precautions I was one
day informed that the manager declined to let the room for two,
but that three would always be welcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The School Board is on the warpath,&rdquo; was my
inward comment, and I never entered the place again.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;correct&rdquo; old hypocrite is long since dead; the scene
of these innocent repasts has long since been demolished, and the
sweet lady who honoured me with her company has long since had a
prefix to her name and become the proud mother of a subaltern in
the Guards.</p>
<p>The inauguration of the Civil Service Stores, and the
subsequent appearance of the Army and Navy Stores, gave the first
fillip to that union between the Army and trade which the
abolition of purchase and the changes in public opinion have
since developed to such an extent.</p>
<p>Captain MacRae, late director-general in Victoria Street, who
in the sixties was a plodding captain of foot, set the fashion by
turning his sword into a tape-measure, and having taken the
plunge lost no time in converting a general officer (some say his
parent) into a laundry-man.&nbsp; Then followed the rush that saw
bonnet shops and costumiers springing up in every <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>fashionable
street, and as Kitties and Reillys and Madges looked favourably
on the military, the crop of Mantalinis increased and multiplied,
and penniless officers became well-to-do men-milliners and
accepted authorities on things military amid their new
client&egrave;le.&nbsp; And so the last nail was driven into that
class distinction that was one of the chief characteristics of
the long-ago Sixties.</p>
<p>Whilst on the subject of hostelries, a reference to
Lane&rsquo;s will not be amiss.&nbsp; This unique establishment
was in St. Alban&rsquo;s Place, and was affected by the rowdier
class of youngsters, with a sprinkling of permanent residents in
various stages of delirium tremens.&nbsp; Dirty and apparently
never swept, the rooms might best be described as cosy.&nbsp; The
beds, however, were scrupulously clean, and as the majority of
the lodgers spent a considerable portion of their existence
between the sheets, apple-pie order reigned in this department,
ready for any emergency by night or day.</p>
<p>The ruling spirit was old John, an octogenarian in shiny
snuff-coloured tail suit and slippers, who apparently never
slumbered nor slept, and whom no human eye had ever seen
otherwise attired.&nbsp; Assisted by two youngsters of
fifty&mdash;Charles and Robert&mdash;this extraordinary trio knew
the habits and tastes of every one; not that eating was
extensively indulged in; and beyond the best of joints for
dinner, and bacon and eggs for breakfast, the staple consumption
for all day and all night might briefly be described as brandy
and soda, rum and milk, whilst the more sedate confined
themselves to sherry and bitters before breakfast, and a glass of
brandy in their tea.&nbsp; How human nature stood such persistent
floodings of the system seems beyond comprehension, yet nothing
seemed to occur beyond revellers being periodically chaperoned to
bed, and now and then an ominous long box being smuggled
upstairs, and one hearing a day or so after that &ldquo;the
Captain&rdquo; <a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>had had his last drink, and had been duly gathered to
his fathers.</p>
<p>Even in those long-ago days the brevet rank was frequently
assumed by ex-militia ensigns, but not to the same extent nor by
such sorry specimens as twirl their moustaches in these more
enlightened times and stand on the doorstep of the Criterion.</p>
<p>Whisky at this period was literally an unknown beverage in
London&mdash;possibly because the supply could never have
equalled the demand, or more probably because science had not yet
evolved the diabolical concoctions that now do duty for the wine
of bonnie Scotland.&nbsp; And so it came to pass that the staple
drink at Lane&rsquo;s was brandy and soda.&nbsp; Come in when one
chose, there stood battalions of soda with brandy in reserve, and
rarely did a wayfarer return at the small hours without calling
for a libation from old Peter.&nbsp; Occasionally, after an
unusual run, the supply might become exhausted, but no temptation
could induce the old janitor to retail what had been reserved on
&ldquo;special order.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What, give you that
one?&nbsp; Why, it&rsquo;s the Captain&rsquo;s; every morning at
five I takes it to his bedside, and if he&rsquo;s asleep in the
smoking-room I gives him a sniff of it, and he follows me to his
room like a dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Visiting the &ldquo;Cheshire Cheese&rdquo; not long since, I
was struck by the marvellous change that the advance of
civilisation (!!) had effected in that most cosy and
unconventional of rooms.&nbsp; The steaks and puddings are still
as good as ever, but the rollicking Bohemians, bristling with
wit, with churchwardens and brown ale that one met at every
table, have long since been replaced by their modern prototypes
who sip their beer out of a glass, call for a <i>serviette</i> in
evidence of a trip to Boulogne, and bolt after depositing a penny
on the table.&nbsp; And where are the jolly old waiters in rusty
tail-coats, shambling along in their carpet slippers, who never
inquired how many <a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>&ldquo;breads&rdquo; you had had nor what had won the
3.40 race?&nbsp; And the Americans who now invade the place are
not an unalloyed blessing, as males and females appear to
consider it a <i>sine qu&acirc; non</i> to flop on to the seat
where Doctor Johnson is once supposed to have sat, in order to be
able to tell poppa and momma in the old Kentucky home how, if
they could not rub shoulders with the mighty living, they had at
least rubbed something with the mighty dead.&nbsp; This
aspiration is indeed almost a disease with these Transatlantic
trotters, and one rich and pronounced snob, despite his wealth,
who lives amongst us, is known to pay for reliable information of
the movements of European heirs-apparent in order to meet them by
accident (!) and perhaps secure some fragment of
recognition.&nbsp; The sequel is usually to be found in an
inspired paragraph (4d. a word) hinting at possible alliance
between the two families, which in its turn is flatly
contradicted!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blood,&rdquo; some genius discovered, &ldquo;is thicker
than water&rdquo;&mdash;and the most unobservant must admit that
some of it is very thick indeed.</p>
<p>And apropos of Doctor Johnson, what evidence is there that the
great lexicographer&rsquo;s rhinoceros laugh ever vibrated
through the &ldquo;Cheshire Cheese&rdquo;?&nbsp; Boswell makes no
reference to it, and surely such an omission would be impossible
in the chronicles of that irrepressible toady&mdash;but when
all&rsquo;s said and done, what importance attaches to it so long
as the fare maintains its pristine excellence and the American
bumpings are restrained within reasonable limits?</p>
<p>When Piccadilly did not consist almost entirely of clubs,
public billiard-rooms were patronised by many who would not enter
a modern one.&nbsp; Many of these were run on the very best
lines, and a regular clientele met every afternoon for sixpenny
and half-crown pools.</p>
<p>The best was Phillips&rsquo;s, at 99, Regent Street, where <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>Edmund
Tattersall, Lord St. Vincent, Colonel Dawes, Attenborough, the
king of pawnbrokers, and a few members of 14, St. James&rsquo;s
Square Club never missed resorting&mdash;wind and weather
permitting&mdash;from three to seven of an afternoon.</p>
<p>No goat from an alien flock dared hope to browse on that
jealously-guarded pasture, and if, as occasionally, one wandered
in, he speedily wandered out under the withering glances of old
Phillips and his son.</p>
<p>Almost opposite were Smith&rsquo;s rooms, where pool of a high
class (in execution) was indulged in, and any amateur with a
local reputation who took a ball soon disabused his mind of any
exalted idea of his play.</p>
<p>Dolby&rsquo;s, near the Marble Arch, had also its regular
patrons, and even in the select region of Portman Square such
correct old gentlemen as Sir James Hamilton, Mr. Burgoyne, and
other residents in the neighbourhood met daily at an
unpretentious tobacconist&rsquo;s in King Street and played pool
in a dingy room behind the shop.</p>
<p>But in the clubs of those long-ago days the most cold-blooded
inhospitality obtained.&nbsp; If you called upon a friend you had
to wait on the door-mat, and the offering of a glass of sherry
was attended by the risk of expulsion.&nbsp;
Smoking-rooms&mdash;if tolerated&mdash;were placed in the attics,
and a &ldquo;strangers&rsquo; room&rdquo; was an innovation that
only came into existence years after.</p>
<p>For long many clubs held out against the recognition of
&ldquo;strangers,&rdquo; and only within the last few years have
the &ldquo;Senior&rdquo; and the more exclusive establishments
over-ruled the snarling objections of the few old fossils who use
a club from morning to night without adding one cent to its
revenue.</p>
<p>It was the privilege of the Army and Navy Club to make the
first drastic move in the right direction, and to Louis
Napoleon&rsquo;s frequent visits for luncheon <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>and its
attendant cigarette and coffee may be traced the present accepted
theory that &ldquo;clubs were made for man, and not man for
clubs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The best tobacconists also supplied the need now provided by
the ubiquitous club, and Harris&rsquo;s, Hoare&rsquo;s,
Benson&rsquo;s, Hudson&rsquo;s, Carlin&rsquo;s in Oxford Street
and Regent Street, each had their following, where every
afternoon such men as Lord William Lennox, Lord Huntingtower, Mr.
George Payne, the Marquis of Drogheda, Lord Henry Loftus, and
Colonel Fitzgerald might be seen seated on tobacco tubs and cigar
chests, smoking big cigars and drinking sherry which flowed from
casks around the shop.</p>
<p>This last-named individual was a morose, fire-eating Irishman,
whose life had been soured by the seduction of his wife by his
own colonel, and later by the ravages of small-pox that had
seared his once-handsome face.</p>
<p>The son of a famous duellist of the days of the Regency, it
was told how on one occasion on entering the Cocoa Tree a
comparative stranger exclaimed: &ldquo;I smell an
Irishman!&rdquo;&nbsp; To which &ldquo;Fighting Fitz&rdquo;
replied: &ldquo;You shall never smell another!&rdquo; and sliced
off his nose on the spot.</p>

150</span>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE DRAMA&mdash;LEGITIMATE AND
OTHERWISE.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> tercentenary of Shakespeare in
&rsquo;64 suggested an experience that many of us were anxious to
participate in.&nbsp; That we were likely to be successful was by
no means certain, for numerous meetings, held at the Caf&eacute;
de l&rsquo;Europe, Haymarket&mdash;where motions innumerable and
brandy <i>ad libitum</i> were proposed and carried&mdash;had
decided that an event so strictly dramatic should not be diluted
by outside association, but rather that scene shifters, stage
carpenters, actors, everything and everybody strictly
&ldquo;legit.&rdquo; should have the preference of guzzling and
swilling to the memory of the immortal poet.&nbsp; But if our
claims were weak, our advocates were strong, and so it came to
pass that on the eventful evening we found ourselves awaiting the
feast in the banqueting room of the Freemason&rsquo;s Tavern.</p>
<p>That the thing was to be unique we were not long in
discovering, as Ben Webster began grace by &ldquo;For what we are
about to receive may the spirit of Shakespeare hover over
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether it was Shakespeare&rsquo;s spirit or the more powerful
libations included in the dinner ticket must be left to greater
dramatic authorities; suffice that long before the speeches
began, practical jokes were in full blast, and eventually
developed into a free fight.</p>
<p>It appears that some scene shifters with voracious appetites
were sending again and again for a slice <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>more
&rsquo;am, till wags of a higher grade, who acted as croupiers,
worn out and disgusted, piled plates with meats, custards,
oranges, and mustard till the blood of every carpenter rose as
one man, and dishes began to fly right, centre, and left.&nbsp;
Even the waiters joined in the tournament, and one, in the act of
placing a plate before me, yelled out, &ldquo;Wait till I give
this &mdash; his grub, and then I&rsquo;ll let you
know.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Damn it,&rdquo; whispered one of our
party, &ldquo;this isn&rsquo;t Shakespearian, surely!&nbsp; For
God&rsquo;s sake let us clear out.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
&ldquo;clearing out&rdquo; was by no means so easy, for at that
moment two or three repulsive ruffians in leather coats and
rabbit-skin caps came upon the scene, whilst one, scowling in
strictly melodramatic style, confronted us with &ldquo;Well,
what&rsquo;s the matter with <i>you</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; But we
managed to slip out without giving the desired explanation, and
so ended the tercentenary and the spirit Ben Webster had
invoked.</p>
<p>People nowadays would hardly realise that theatregoers in
those long-ago days could wade through alleys and side streets by
no means safe after dark to visit the (then) Prince of
Wales&rsquo;s in a slum off the Tottenham Court Road.&nbsp; With
an excellent company, however, and with houris since translated
to the peerage and knightage, the little house was nightly
crammed, and white ties by the score blocked the thoroughfare in
the vicinity of the modest stage door as resolutely as in later
years they besieged the Philharmonic and the Gaiety.</p>
<p>Valentine Baker at the time was running the show, or a
material portion of it, and much of the profits of his
wife&rsquo;s soap-boiling industry, it was said, found their way
into the coffers of the unpretentious little temple in the
slum.&nbsp; A wealthy cabinet maker, also in the vicinity, whose
profits permitted the luxury of a four-in-hand, might usually be
seen worshipping at the shrine, and a tag-rag and bobtail of less
wealthy but aspiring young bloods fought and hustled for <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>one glance,
one sign of recognition, from the bevy beyond the footlights.</p>
<p>When Valentine Baker began casting sheep&rsquo;s eyes at the
demure maiden reading the <i>Family Herald</i> in a South-Western
compartment, he little realised that the price he was paying
might have been commuted elsewhere by the judicious expenditure
of a five-pound note.&nbsp; Twenty thousand in hard cash, the
command of a great regiment, and social annihilation&mdash;for
what?&nbsp; And when Mr. Justice Brett began his charge to the
jury by &ldquo;a man we looked to to protect our women and
children,&rdquo; there was not an Army man present (and the
Croydon Court House was crammed with them) that did not
internally vow that henceforth, be it in a first-class or a
third-class compartment, be it Piccadilly Circus or the British
Museum, woman should be his constant care, and, if necessary, any
tadpole that lawfully pertained to her.</p>
<p>The rumour came like a thunderbolt, and in every Army club the
whispered communication ran: &ldquo;Valentine Baker is arrested,
by Gad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No man at this time had such a universal personality&mdash;the
colonel of the crackest of all crack regiments; the admittedly
best cavalry leader of the day; the patron of the drama, and in
intimate touch with the Prince of Wales&rsquo;s Theatre, then
under the management of Marie Wilton, since developed into a
pillar of Holy Church&mdash;the thing seemed incredible, and
curiosity ran high to gaze upon the houri that had been so
fatally misread by this experienced veteran.</p>
<p>The crowds that surrounded the Court House made access
impossible; to hope for admission was the aspiration of a
lunatic, when &ldquo;Come this way, my lord&rdquo;&mdash;as my
companion was recognised&mdash;reached our ears, and we found
ourselves under an open window, ten feet from the ground, at the
back of the court.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stand next the wall,&rdquo; continued our
guide, <a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>&ldquo;and you get on my shoulders,&rdquo; and then an
acrobatic performance took place that would have insured an
engagement at any music-hall.</p>
<p>The sequel is matter of history.</p>
<p>Years after&mdash;in &rsquo;94&mdash;I met him in Cairo, an
altered, broken man, in daily expectation of being appointed
Commander-in-Chief of the Egyptian Army.&nbsp; But Nemesis had
not done with him yet&mdash;prudery, hypocrisy, blue-stockingism
were still rampant, and a telegram from London vetoed the
intended appointment.</p>
<p>The official explanation was that a &ldquo;cashiered
man&rdquo; could not command full-pay British officers with which
the Egyptian Army swarmed, whilst the universal opinion was that
a brave man was being hounded to his death under the cloak of
that charity that flourished in its prime during the days of the
Inquisition.</p>
<p>Next year he died in Egypt&mdash;broken in health and broken
in heart&mdash;and those that knew his brilliant attainments, and
the heights they would assuredly have led to, agreed
that&mdash;like Napoleon&mdash;he should have died years before
at the head of his men.</p>
<p>The Strand Theatre also was a highly popular resort, run
exclusively by the Swanborough family and their numerous sisters,
cousins, and aunts.</p>
<p>To &ldquo;The Old Lady,&rdquo; rightly or wrongly, was
attributed every <i>malaprop</i> that ingenious wits invented,
and in later years, when the Dor&eacute; Gallery and the
Criterion Restaurant simultaneously came into existence, she was
reputed to have expressed intense admiration of the Dor&eacute;
masterpiece, &ldquo;Christ leaving the Criterium.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pothouse&mdash;pure and simple&mdash;across the Strand was a
favourite after-theatre resort of this (then) brightest of
companies, and in a specially reserved room might nightly be seen
sweet Nelly Bromley, young as ever, despite her youthful brood of
dukes <a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>and duchesses and his Grace of Beaufort; Eleanor
Bufton, Fanny Josephs, Fanny Hughes, and a host of others, all
charming, clever, and young, and, alas! all passed away.</p>
<p>The proprietor of this unpretentious hostelry was a pimply,
fly-blown individual, who before you had been five minutes in his
company told you that <i>he</i> was the rightful Duke of Norfolk,
who by some legal jugglery had been choused out of his
birthright; he, too, has long been swept away, and so the present
peer remains unmolested in his title.</p>
<p>Passing through the Strand not long since, I was attracted by
the new Tube station, and entering its portals for &ldquo;auld
lang syne&rdquo; I was distressed, but not surprised, to find
nothing of the happy hum that once characterised the transformed
spot.&nbsp; For here stood the little Strand Theatre of the
sixties in all the glory of its original popularity before it was
improved (?) and modernised, only to find it had become out of
the perspective, and so to be handed over to eternal
obliteration.</p>
<p>The old Strand may surely claim to be the root of the
theatrical genealogical tree, for from its original stock
(company) sprang every sprig that struck root elsewhere to became
famous either through theatrical enterprise, matrimonial
enterprise, or any of the lucrative channels that commend
themselves to commercial talent.</p>
<p>For the phalanx that once worked as a whole, would according
to present custom, be split into a dozen &ldquo;one-part&rdquo;
companies, with the necessary embroidery of Bodega men,
motor-cum-masher women, and a sprinkling of earnest artistes by
way of cohesion.</p>
<p>A few years later the family grouping that originally
characterised the Strand was intruded upon by one H. B. Farnie,
whose forte was the adaptation of opera-bouffe.&nbsp;
Unquestionably an adept in this particular <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>line, the
man was a libertine of a pronounced character, with the result
that the chorus at the Strand and the Opera Comique was the very
daintiest conceivable.&nbsp; If a houri yielded to this Blue
Beard&rsquo;s blandishments, her advancement was assured, and she
was fitted to minor parts; if his overtures fell on deaf ears,
nothing was too bad for her, and her lot was not a successful
one.&nbsp; Occasionally, as a consequence, the hum-drum routine
of a rehearsal was enlivened by such unrehearsed incidents as the
appearance of an irate brother, and, on one occasion, an
exasperated fishmonger from the Theobald&rsquo;s Road (the
combination sounds boisterous), burst in at a critical period of
a comic duet and belaboured the unhappy impresario to within an
inch of his life.</p>
<p>These cases are, happily, rare at the present day, although,
if rumour is correct, a Hebrew of dramatic tastes, who, a few
years ago, developed into theatre owner, and staged his own
pieces, could tell of a similar experience which practically led
to his abandonment of the active pursuit of the drama.</p>
<p>When the fair Lardy Wilson, whom we last heard of at the
Surrey, had risen into prominence by reason of her exalted
connection, she joined the old Philharmonic, at Islington, in the
zenith of its glory; so privileged indeed had this darling of
Alfred become that, appearing in the &ldquo;green room&rdquo; on
one occasion with an infant swaddled in purple and fine linen,
the manager, band conductor, principals&mdash;male and
female&mdash;and the chorus <i>en bloc</i>, are said to have
bowed down and worshipped, as was only meet and proper and to be
expected of a &ldquo;loyal and dutiful&rdquo; people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wiry Sal&rdquo; was also a delightful member of the
company, and soon obtained European fame by being able to kick
higher, in a graceful, abandoned way, than any exponent of the
art before or since.</p>
<p>Pretty little Camille Dubois, who eventually developed into a
Stanhope, was also at this delightful <a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>house.&nbsp; Her father at the time
was conductor at the Opera Comique, and on one occasion having
congratulated him on the execution of an excruciating
<i>morceau</i> that I was aware had emanated from his inspired
brain, I expressed a desire to procure a copy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ach, mein Gott!&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;it is a
gavotte in F.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gavottes in F are, happily, rare inspirations!</p>
<p>For although burlesque lent itself to the display of a bevy of
beautiful choristers, mashing had not then attained its present
barefaced dimensions, and the cab outside and the calf (just)
inside were the exception, not the rule, in those jovial
days.</p>
<p>But when Ada and Lizzie&mdash;as sometimes occurred&mdash;were
sisters, it often happened that some system was necessary to
insure a properly balanced larder, for from a conversation once
overheard, two hams had come from the guardsman and the lordling,
whereas the smallest forethought would have insured
otherwise.</p>
<p>But the belle of the show was one Laura, who, discovered in
the purlieus of Islington, developed into the rage of London, and
her beautiful face was to be seen on Easter eggs, Egyptian
cigarettes, and at the picture shops, as Connie Gilchrist, the
Countess of Lonsdale, and other beauties figured at a later
day.</p>
<p>Her personality attracted&mdash;as may be assumed&mdash;all
the front rank mashers, and Harry Tyrwhitt, Douglas Gordon, and
Jimmy Douglas were nightly imploring D&rsquo;Albertson and
Hitchins to present them to the goddess.</p>
<p>But this fatal beauty led to a row, and the jealous swain who
was responsible for the fair Laura&rsquo;s well-being was not
long in bringing matters to an issue.</p>
<p>It was on Ash Wednesday, when our national
hypocrisy&mdash;since taken other shapes&mdash;closed the
theatres, with the exception of the Alhambra, that the fair
chorister decided to &ldquo;visit her parents.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Nothing <a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>loth to encourage such filial piety, her inamorato put
her into a cab, and then&mdash;with an eye to
business&mdash;judiciously followed.</p>
<p>The sequel was a sad disillusionment, for getting out at the
stage door, she proceeded towards the Embankment, and there by
easy stages&mdash;accompanied by an admirer&mdash;the pair
proceeded to a private box at the Alhambra.</p>
<p>The rest is briefly told; a thundering knock at the box door,
shouts of &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; from all parts of the house, the
orchestra stopped, old Jacobi standing in his stirrups, and an
ignominious exit for all concerned.</p>
<p>Later the sweet girl went on tour with one of Alec
Henderson&rsquo;s companies, and met a bagman she eventually
married.</p>
<p>The bagman has since developed into one of the largest
shopkeepers in Knightsbridge, and so good came out of evil, and
the course &ldquo;true love&rdquo; usually runs in marrying an
Italian waiter and living on macaroni was diverted, and
everything a real &ldquo;loidy&rdquo; should have became hers for
life.</p>
<p>And the development of the fair creature&rsquo;s life was
frequently under my observation.&nbsp; Beginning with a
preference for a &ldquo;steak and a glass of stout,&rdquo; she
soon developed into an authority on champagne; instead of worsted
gloves&mdash;or no gloves&mdash;nothing but Dumont&rsquo;s mauve
mousquetaires would satisfy her, and so blas&eacute;e did she
become during her nightly visits to Romano&rsquo;s that she could
not sum up sufficient energy to remove her sixteen-franc gloves
when picking an artichoke.&nbsp; One marvels at the true origin
of these phenomena when under observation during the transition
state from gutter to Debrett, for although all of us have seen
the mothers, no human eye has ever seen the male progenitor of
any of these extraordinary beings, who toil not neither do they
spin, yet rise to the highest positions, have their babies <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>kissed by
the Kaiser, and all by sheer superficial excellence.</p>
<p>Yet another face arises before me, and sweet Grace O&mdash;,
resisting every blandishment of Jew and Gentile, stands
prominently out in the simple attire of a modest maiden, amid the
sables and baubles by which she was surrounded.&nbsp; No adorers
waited for her, although the bombardment by letter and overture
was incessant; smirky acting-managers enlisted against her,
reminded her that no stalls were booked by her
<i>client&egrave;le</i>, parcels at the stage door remained as
they were left, and nightly the sweet girl trudged across
Waterloo Bridge to her humble abode at Kennington, whilst half a
dozen broughams only awaited the chance of flicking her to a
<i>cabinet particulier</i> at the Caf&eacute; Riche or
Kettner&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Often, as she told me at a later period,
she entered her hovel tired and hungry with nothing better than a
herring and a crust with which to fortify herself for the
monotonous routine of next day and every day, the lot then, and
now, of many a tender plant in uncongenial soil.</p>
<p>But every created thing has its breaking point&mdash;the
balloon overflated will eventually burst, and the egg pressed too
hard will assuredly break; and sweet Grace, no exception to the
unalterable law of Nature, like a lily before the hurricane, bent
before the assault that assailed her on every side.</p>
<p>It was like an ironclad charging an outrigger, when men of the
Farnie type entered the lists against an honest and attractive
chorister, and the sequel of short duration in Ashley Place was
told me by the unhappy girl.&nbsp; Gold at this stage was
lavished upon her, and a miniature brougham and
tiger&mdash;intended as a surprise&mdash;was scornfully ignored
as it waited for her at the Royalty, and was eventually on
sale&mdash;as unused as on the day it left its builders&mdash;in
Long Acre.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can endure this gilded cage so long as
no one knows it, but the shame of the brougham!&nbsp; I <a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>would
rather have dropped than enter it.&rdquo;&nbsp; So spoke the
woman, and within a month she walked out of the palatial
establishment to revert to her humble life.</p>
<p>It was a perky Jew, enormously rich, with great back-door
theatrical influence, that sought to shape this phenomenal
disposition into a regard for his uncongenial charms.&nbsp; But
manly beauty of such matured and pronounced types, with its
Malacca canes and vulgar jewellery&mdash;like olives and a love
for babies&mdash;are acquired tastes, and not the baits to allure
the &ldquo;Graces&rdquo; of this sordid world, and years after,
when chance again threw me across her path, our heroine was the
happy wife of a worthy City clerk, and Ashley Place and the Jew
and the brougham had long since been forgotten like the incidents
of a hideous nightmare.</p>
<p>This is no overdrawn fairy tale, and what existed then exists
now, at least in one popular resort, and two sisters with youth,
good looks, and stage experience now &ldquo;resting,&rdquo; could
tell how the only accomplishment of which they were deficient was
their inability to fill a few stalls&mdash;on terms.</p>
<p>In later years the infant phenomenon became the craze, and
Topsey, of the Royalty, and Connie, of the music-halls, and a
cloud of imitators all bid for recognition.&nbsp; Some&mdash;like
Esther&mdash;had the golden sceptre held out, and &ldquo;came and
sat beside the king,&rdquo; whilst others less fortunate
fulfilled their natural destiny and became the wives of the local
tobacconist or greengrocer, and many of them would now be shocked
if asked the number of yards between the pond and the Hampstead
Fever Hospital, or the sensations of dancing to a hurdy-gurdy on
the boulevards of Camden Town.</p>
<p>And so history is made, and pedigrees traced to
&ldquo;de&rdquo; something&mdash;who came over with the
Conqueror&mdash;with here and there a stiffening from a Chicago
pork butchery, and it only remains for you and me, my brother
snobs, to pray that whatever trials the Fates <a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>may have in
store for us, we may not be bereft of our old nobility.</p>
<p>The recent death of the once-popular Chief of the Fire
Brigade, Eyre Shaw, recalls many stirring scenes that lit up the
West End in the long-ago sixties, when theatres bore a
considerable share of the conflagrations that partially or
entirely destroyed some of our most notable playhouses.</p>
<p>It was in &rsquo;65 that the old Surrey was in flames, to be
replaced later on by the present structure, more familiar to the
present generation as associated with the d&eacute;but of such
popular artistes as Lardy Wilson, Nelly Moon, Val Reece (Lady
Meux of the 20th century), Rose Mandeville, and others under the
management of Bill Holland, and the distinguished patronage of
names too sacred to mention save with bated breath and in
reverential tones.</p>
<p>Three years later the Oxford Music Hall was burned down, but
those caves of harmony were less pretentious in those days, and
so the conflagration, except as a sight, did not provoke much
interest.&nbsp; But a blaze that occurred in December, &rsquo;67,
roused all London, and as a &ldquo;spectacle&rdquo; surpassed
anything that had ever been depicted on its stage, and put in the
shade the Guy Fawkes celebrations of the previous month.</p>
<p>In that memorable year Her Majesty&rsquo;s Theatre, without
any apparent rhyme or reason, burst into flame, and despite
herculean efforts was soon a heap of cinders.&nbsp; For the
construction, as may be supposed, was wood and old, and those
chiefly interested were probably gainers by the drastic accident,
except perhaps Mapleson, who was said to have lost &pound;12,000,
and Madame Tietjens, &pound;2,000.&nbsp; But Tod Heatly, the
ground landlord, could hardly have regretted it, for it opened up
possibilities of improving the site which, after many years,
culminated in the present establishment, with its profitable
addenda of an hotel with its &ldquo;lardy-da&rdquo; luncheon and
supper rooms.</p>
<p><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>In
those remote days the Metropolitan Board of Works was the
controlling authority, and bone counters which emanated from them
passed the holders within the cordon on any of these interesting
occasions.</p>
<p>Eyre Shaw, too, about this time was appointed chief officer,
and being an enthusiastic patron of the Gaiety (then only a
precocious infant with every promise of its present development)
little wonder that the bone counters were in considerable
evidence amongst the present-day old ladies who then represented
the Connies and Dollies and Lizzies of burlesque.</p>
<p>Contemplating the still-smouldering ruins, how complete
appeared the obliteration of many notable incidents.&nbsp; Here
Mario&mdash;approaching seventy&mdash;was acclaimed to the echo
by a gushing house, after having been hissed off the stage in
Paris for mumbling what he once used to sing; here Giulini
thrilled the world with the purest tenor ever heard, and died in
the madhouse in the zenith of his fame; here later, Moody and
Sankey bellowed in solo and in duet, and stopped the traffic by
the eager crowds that sought admission (free) to bellow in the
chorus; here, too, sweet little Chiomi essayed to make her
d&eacute;but in <i>Lucia</i> and failed; and here Lord Dudley,
Carpenter, Vandeleur-Lee, Goodenough, and a host long since swept
into the universal dust-bin, beamed nightly on Tietjens and
Fanchelli with expressions supposed to denote familiarity with
the text; here under its dismal porticoes sights of distress and
starvation&mdash;forgotten in slumber&mdash;were nightly to be
met with, as painful as anything that ever appealed to De Quincey
outside the Oxford Street Pantheon, and here old Leader, prince
of Bohemians and managing director of the Alhambra in the zenith
of its pranky days, had a box office till he dropped from old
age; here on one occasion on the son of one of the celebrated
Irish Army agents being presented to him, the Royal George
patronisingly greeted him with, &ldquo;Oh, indeed, a son of
&lsquo;Borough and <a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>Armit,&rsquo;&rdquo; and received the explanatory
reply: &ldquo;No, sir, only of Armit;&rdquo; and on the ghosts of
all these departed memories not one stone now stands upon another
to bridge, as it were, the present with the glorious past.</p>
<p>In these latter days, a conflagration such as this would, of
course, be impossible, as witness the blaze not long since in
Holborn.&nbsp; But then that was a <i>fire proof</i>
construction.</p>

163</span>CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MOSTLY &ldquo;OTHERWISE&rdquo;</span>
(continued).</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the long-ago sixties the
Artillery Ball at Woolwich was the most select and the most
sought after function that the dancing community yearned for, and
about the same time Major Goodenough, a popular officer of this
distinguished regiment&mdash;although close upon eighteen
stone&mdash;fell desperately in love with Tietjens, herself of
large pattern.&nbsp; Rumour, indeed, asserted that the ponderous
couple were engaged, and so it came to pass that poor old Goody
was nonplussed almost to distraction when his application for a
ticket for his fianc&eacute;e was politely but firmly
refused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s engaged to me,&rdquo; the poor old chap
pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when she&rsquo;s Mrs. Goodenough we shall always he
delighted to see her,&rdquo; was the stern, uncompromising
reply.</p>
<p>Such exclusiveness&mdash;which shows that snobbery was even
then approaching with gigantic strides&mdash;contrasts amusingly
with what was then the composition of many of our
&ldquo;crack&rdquo; regiments.</p>
<p>Otway Toler&mdash;a brother of the Earl of Norbury&mdash;was
one of the best amateur musicians, and it was through his kindly
offices that I became acquainted with Giulini and other leading
opera singers in London.</p>
<p>No such voice as that gifted being&rsquo;s has ever been <a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>heard
before or since, and it is sad to recollect that whilst yet in
the zenith of his fame he was ruthlessly struck down by insanity,
and eventually died in a madhouse.</p>
<p>It was during this painful period that his voice is said to
have reached a pitch of pathos that far exceeded anything it
attained when he thrilled London nightly.</p>
<p>To compare it with any tenor that may suggest itself to the
reader would be as absurd as comparing an English concertina to
the most glorious notes of the most fluty instrument, and yet
this divine voice was silenced without apparent cause, and the
world&mdash;the operatic world&mdash;will never hear its like
again.</p>
<p>As an old lady in tears was once overheard to say to her
unmusical spouse at the opera: &ldquo;It is the voice of a god,
and not of a man,&rdquo; to which her phlegmatic better-half
replied: &ldquo;Bosh, you should hear Sims Reeves; he can go an
octave higher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sims Reeves, indeed!&nbsp; But no matter&mdash;may they both
rest in peace.</p>
<p>To go to an unpretentious Italian eating-house in Old Compton
Street, Soho, that has long disappeared, was as good as attending
the opera&mdash;if one was in the magic circle.&nbsp; Here all
day, and every day, congregated the leading exponents, male and
female, of Italian opera.&nbsp; At a piano on the first floor
finishing touches were given to morceaux, duets were tried over,
and, in addition to the vocalists, soloists of the highest order
&ldquo;ran through&rdquo; special passages of their scores, while
below, viands of the strictest Italian type were being consumed
from morning to night.</p>
<p>Here osso-buco, and minestrone, and spaghetti were to be found
as undiluted as at Savini&rsquo;s in Milan, and washed down with
such productions of the vine as Chianti, Lacrima Christi, and
Capri.</p>
<p>No abominations in imitation of French cookery were to be
found here.&nbsp; No half-crown dinners of <a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>half-a-dozen courses, with their deadly accompaniments
of artichokes fried in tallow (<i>au Cardinal</i>) would have
been permitted here; no New Zealand mutton garnished with
turnip-tops (<i>ris d&eacute; veau garni aux truffes</i>) could
have showed its unhallowed head in those sacred precincts and
lived, for no mashers of the present-day type existed, and shop
boys and shop girls knew their places too well to venture into
such reserved pastures, even with the prospect of eating a
veritable dinner as served on the Continong.</p>
<p>One cannot leave the subject of music without a reference to
the promenade concerts that came into being about this period at
the Queen&rsquo;s in Long Acre.</p>
<p>It was here that the first public exhibition of the telephone
was given, and when a series of grunts had vibrated through the
hall and a bald-headed old patriarch had told us that the sound
actually came from Westminster, the surprise and delight of the
enraptured audience was intense, and we marvelled where such
discoveries would end.</p>
<p>And the fun and the frolic at these gatherings was beyond
description, often more delectable than correct, but nevertheless
delightful and invigorating.&nbsp; The orchestra, moreover, was
superb, and the vocalists the best that money could provide, and
all these delights were presided over by one Rivi&egrave;re, a
pushing musical instrument-maker in Leicester Square, who by
sheer impudence had forced himself into prominence before an
ignorant public whilst all the time incapable of reading the most
ordinary score at sight.</p>
<p>So far as execution and diabolical contortions were concerned
he was immense, and as big an impostor as Jullien himself.</p>
<p>When Offenbach was all the rage, and Schneider (under Lord
C.&rsquo;s wing) was his principal exponent, I had the honour of
being one of a privileged half-dozen who did homage to the Diva
at a dinner party <a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>in a private room at Limmer&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Although in
the zenith of her fame, her personal charms at the time were
unquestionably on the wane, and I can recollect her comments on
popularity and what it was worth as she told us how ten years
previously, when young and beautiful, she had appeared in London
only to be ignored, and that now everybody was at her feet.&nbsp;
And then she shrugged her shoulders with an indescribable
fascination peculiarly her own, and complacently puffed away at
her cigarette.</p>
<p>It may have been a few years later that Major Carpenter, a
wealthy amateur musician, introduced to the operatic world a
charming English girl, who, under cover of the Italian name of
Chiomi, was to electrify London with her singing.</p>
<p>The opera the fair d&eacute;butante selected was probably the
most formidable a nervous subject could have chosen; and so one
night every one attended at Her Majesty&rsquo;s to hear
<i>Lucia</i> expounded.&nbsp; Everything went well up to the mad
scene, when, unaccompanied by orchestra, the unhappy heroine has
to sing and toss straws about amid a series of impossible runs
and shakes.&nbsp; With the straw tossing no fault could be found,
but the voice that should have been moving us all to tears was a
series of gurgles that eventually subsided into silence.</p>
<p>Sir Michael Costa meanwhile sat grim and immovable, when a few
bars would probably have nerved up the fluttering victim, but
<i>that</i> to that orthodox Italian would have been
&ldquo;trifling with the text,&rdquo; and so no aid was
forthcoming, and the trumpet blasts that had emanated from Ashley
Place ended in a fiasco, and sweet little Chiomi was heard of no
more.</p>
<p>That the drama is occasionally unjustly disparaged is nothing
new; that it occasionally produces indirect beneficial effects
and even prolongs life may be gleaned from the example of a
deceased colonel of <a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>the Bays, who, returning from India
in the sixties with a life not worth six months&rsquo; purchase,
married a lady connected with the Canterbury Music Hall, and,
after increasing the music-hall population, literally died of
senile decay within the last year or two.</p>
<p>It was my privilege, on one occasion, in the company of Otway
Toler, who knew all the stars, to visit the great tenor Mario and
his wife, the equally celebrated Grisi, who had a house during
the opera season in the vicinity of Cavendish Square.&nbsp;
Grisi, it may be explained, at the time of her marriage, was the
proud mother of two children who, by one of those extraordinary
freaks of nature one occasionally meets with, resembled in a
remarkable degree the family that followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These,&rdquo; pointing to one group, was Grisi&rsquo;s
usual introduction, &ldquo;are the <i>Marionettes</i>, and
these&rdquo;&mdash;indicating the others&mdash;&ldquo;are the
<i>Grisettes</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Incredible as it may appear, one of the purest tenors the
world has ever produced did not know one note of music, and
everything had to be drummed into him by a fiddle.&nbsp; It was
at the house at Eaton Place of one of the leading ladies of
society that one often met the great tenor, where music
alternated with the cotillon and other delights of one&rsquo;s
youth.</p>
<p>About this time the Alhambra, which for some years had been
waning in public estimation, obtained a new lease of popularity
under the broad-minded direction of one Leader.</p>
<p>This worthy man, to use the familiar expression,
&ldquo;grasped the situation,&rdquo; and with the able
co-operation of his co-directors&mdash;Nagle, head of a
celebrated firm of bill-stickers; Willing, an enlightened
philanthropist and patron of the drama; Captain Fryer (who was
accorded that title because he had a second cousin in the
Dragoons)&mdash;inaugurated an enlightened policy that seemed to
provide &ldquo;a want long felt,&rdquo; and met <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>the
requirements of their numerous patrons (<i>vide</i> daily papers,
etc.).</p>
<p>The directors&rsquo; box was a huge omnibus capable of holding
goodness knows how many, and consisted of partitions innumerable
that had been dealt with by the carpenters; a convenient door led
to the stage, and to the managing-director&rsquo;s room&mdash;the
objective of all visitors&mdash;as was only to be expected in a
well-conducted theatre.&nbsp; Here were to be met nightly Alfred
Paget, a septuagenarian lord, who, when not in attendance at
Court, as was supposed, seemed to spend his declining years in
wandering from one green room to another.&nbsp; Harmless to a
degree, it was pitiable to see the dyed old sinner, chewing a
cigar, and indulging in such antics as an occasional
double-shuffle with any chorus girl he had selected for his
attention.</p>
<p>The Maharajah Dhuleep Singh, too, was in nightly attendance,
and never failed to bring some gimcrack which he displayed in the
green room with the inquiry: &ldquo;What nice little girl going
to have this?&rdquo;&nbsp; This, however, was before he had
concentrated his affections on pretty Polly Ash, who appearing
nightly in white kids up to her elbows gave mortal offence to her
fellow-choristers by showing up the cotton &ldquo;sevens&rdquo;
supplied by the management.&nbsp; Polly, however, was not devoid
of common sense, and retired shortly after into a sumptuous flat
in Covent Garden and an annuity that survived the donor.</p>
<p>The green room of the old Alhambra was of extensive
dimensions, and contained more deal tables than probably any
green room before or since.&nbsp; By a magnanimous minute of the
directors, ladies of the chorus and ballet had the entr&eacute;e,
and, although none of the plainer members of the company appeared
to take advantage of the privilege, every table was fully
furnished with champagne (brand doubtful), and giggling artistes
and their adorers.&nbsp; Every one smoked like a donkey-engine,
and the genial managing <a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>director percolated amongst his
guests with a kindly inquiry as to how you were getting on.&nbsp;
History does not make it quite clear whether any of the fair
members were eventually translated to the Upper House; but
whether as fortunate in this respect as Mott&rsquo;s and in later
years the Gaiety, it was undeniable that no more beautiful bevy
of women were to be found than the representatives of the drama
at the Alhambra in those long-ago days.</p>
<p>Captain (!!) Fryer as a director was in considerable demand
during the orgies, and a youthful ensign on one occasion (when
under the fraternising influence of the stock champagne) having
invited the &ldquo;Captain&rdquo; to mess, was considerably put
about on being informed by the colonel that he was at once to
cancel the invitation.&nbsp; With the ingenuity of youth,
however, he wriggled out of the difficulty by changing the venu
to Limmer&rsquo;s, and taking him and a select party to
Mott&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>In appearance the Captain gave the idea of having just missed
being a gentleman; with a waist abnormally small, and a waistcoat
abnormally tight, his shoulders stood out by the aid of whalebone
in a manner intended to convey herculean proportions.&nbsp; When
he walked it was with the swinging motion attributed by
&ldquo;Ouida&rdquo; to heroes who crumple pint pots without
knowing it, and kick garden rollers about as one would a pebble;
he stamped also occasionally with one foot as heavy dragoons once
did when they desired to clink their spurs, but which, after all,
may only have been a habit contracted by the contemplation of his
second cousin who had been in the cavalry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do come here, you provoking Captain,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Did you hear what that absurd Captain just said?&rdquo;
and Captain this, and Captain that vibrated through the room to
the no small annoyance of the &ldquo;civilians&rdquo;
present.&nbsp; From all which it will be seen that he was <a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>a very fine
fellow indeed, and the idol of the ladies of the ballet.&nbsp;
But Bobby and some of the youngsters also swore by him to a man;
to have the run of the entire back premises, and to be introduced
to any siren their fickle fancies desired, was not a privilege to
be lightly appraised, and they vowed, till forbidden by the
adjutant, that he would be the life and soul of the mess on the
next guest night, and that the very rafters would tingle as he
recounted his multifarious experiences.</p>
<p>Another theatre that afforded amusement of a different type
was the Grecian, and night after night parties of from ten to
twenty were made up during the pantomime season to witness the
best of pantomimists in his incomparable part.&nbsp; Not that
such a privilege was lightly undertaken, for, to begin with,
Conquest had to be warned to knock two or three boxes into one,
then dinner in the (private) Octagon Room of the &ldquo;Ship and
Turtle&rdquo; in Leadenhall Street had to be ordered, and
then&mdash;and then only&mdash;the organised party proceeded
eastwards in a private omnibus about 5 p.m.</p>
<p>It may seem silly and suggestive of senile decay to descant on
such frivolities, but who of the present generation can realise
the homely, sumptuous repast that awaited one at the famous old
hostelry of the sixties?&nbsp; The milk-punch specially served by
Painter himself, the incomparable turtle soup and turtle steaks,
the saddle of mutton one felt it a sin to mutilate, and the
honest English pancakes washed down with port&mdash;fifty years
old&mdash;and champagne in magnums were one and all incomparable;
and then the start as the omnibus pulled up at the door, and the
smoking of cigars of brands now unknown, till one alighted at the
portals of the Grecian in the City Road, adjoining the celebrated
&ldquo;Eagle,&rdquo; made famous by the antics of the eccentric
weasel that we are assured went &ldquo;pop&rdquo; every time it
entered its hospitable <a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>doors.&nbsp; Can anything of to-day
compare with it?&nbsp; But the days of regret for these honest
old enjoyments are sadly out of place in these enlightened times,
where comic opera has superseded the transformation scene with
its adjuncts of clown, pantaloons, and harlequin.&nbsp; The
performance and the historian are alike out of perspective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Mabel, shall we go to the Covent Garden
ball?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us extend our ramble to merry Islington and peep in at the
Philharmonic, where now stands the Grand; and although we take a
leap into the seventies for the nonce, the &ldquo;long ago&rdquo;
is sufficiently distant to be beyond the ken of many of our
readers.</p>
<p>The rage for Offenbach was at this time at its height, and
Soldene and Dolaro drew all the golden calves from the West to
gaze on the things of beauty that were provided for their
delectation.</p>
<p>A sporting bookmaker&mdash;Charley Head&mdash;who ran the
show, realising that the majority of his patrons were incapable
of distinguishing &ldquo;Hunkey Dorum&rdquo; from the National
Anthem (&ldquo;The Honeysuckle and the Bee&rdquo; was, happily,
unknown in those days), decided that if the principals were of
the highest class, the chorus might fairly be selected for
perfection of form rather than perfection of voice, and some
seventy of the most beautiful girls in London were engaged to add
<i>&eacute;clat</i> to the performance.</p>
<p>It was currently reported that half their weekly salary of
three shillings was paid in counters, to be expended in the salon
after the performance; and the roaring trade in champagne that
ensued amply repaid the astute manager&rsquo;s calculations.</p>
<p>The drama, run on these lines, naturally produced impresarios
of a questionable class, and Leo Egremont, in an expanse of white
waistcoat and a stripe down his trousers, was nightly ubiquitous
and effusively gushing in his attendance on the golden <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>calves.&nbsp; A ballad singer (at the Cave of Harmony)
before he lost his voice&mdash;a basso of the deepest
dye&mdash;he had lately opened a &ldquo;bureau&rdquo; and
advertised for novelties which he &ldquo;placed&rdquo;&mdash;as
he termed it&mdash;as the demand and circumstances suggested.</p>
<p>The streaky nobleman and the toothless lady who could sing
three octaves had been presented through his enterprise to an
East-end audience, and when the &ldquo;Phil&rdquo; opened under
such unique auspices, Egremont lost no time in securing a
footing.</p>
<p>He also belonged to the &ldquo;Howlers,&rdquo; a half club,
half pot-house, in the vicinity of the Strand.</p>
<p>But the poor old &ldquo;Phil&rdquo; has long since been burnt
to the ground, Egremont has disappeared below the horizon, and
the memories of the seventies are gone to join the mountain of
reminiscences of the long-ago Sixties.</p>
<p>Across the river, the Surrey&mdash;run on broader
lines&mdash;was also responsible for the hatching of numerous
future hereditary legislators, and during the pantomime season
might be found such goddesses as Val Reece, Lardy Wilson, and a
score of others, many of whom have since swelled the pages of
Debrett and similar works of our religion.</p>
<p>It is no more than the truth to assert that this latter
lady&mdash;for she had a way with her not strictly
histrionic&mdash;very nearly upset by her personality a certain
Anglo-Russian marriage at a critical period of the
negotiations.</p>
<p>The Lamp of Burlesque had not yet been lighted, nor even
trimmed, in the future Gaiety&mdash;which at the time was a
&ldquo;rub-a-dub&rdquo; of the lowest class&mdash;and so the
rumours of duels that filled the air years later between a
military attach&eacute; and an <i>off-shoot</i> of the noble
House of Clanricarde still slumbered in the womb of futurity,
only to be roused to vitality by the nimble graces of Kate
Vaughan and sweet little Nell Farren.</p>
<p><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>Passing the Charing Cross Hotel one day, an old
semi-theatrical warrior returned visibly to my mind, and I could
again see Alfred Paget descending the stairs after one of those
informal meetings of directors that occasionally took place in
Edward Watkins&rsquo;s rooms.&nbsp; For the would-be juvenile on
the high road to senile decay that the present generation may
remember was a very different man to the Lord Alfred of the
Sixties, or, looking further back, to the handsome young equerry
who pranced beside the late Queen&rsquo;s carriage in all the
glory of manhood.&nbsp; And then incidents long forgotten were
re-enacted in my muddled brain; how as a director of the
South-Eastern he claimed, or obtained, or arranged, that all
repairs on his steam yacht should be done by the artificers and
engineers of the company.&nbsp; And then, by no great effort, the
<i>Santa Maria</i> appeared lying off Margate Pier, and Old
Alfred&mdash;as he was gradually becoming&mdash;faultlessly
attired on &ldquo;post captain&rdquo; lines, waiting for his boon
companion, Alec Henderson, or possibly a &ldquo;Poppit,&rdquo; as
all his &ldquo;frivolities&rdquo; were christened.&nbsp; And then
the launch lying at the steps, and the revels on board, and the
grateful &ldquo;poppits&rdquo; going over the side after being
presented with a straw hat or some article of female attire found
in the state cabin, belonging to heaven knows who, during the
more respectable cruises.&nbsp; And then the trips to Boulogne
and the stocking the store-room with cheap wines, which the
genial old sinner chuckled would thus evade duty and come in
handy at second-chop gatherings.&nbsp; For with all his display
his lordship was undoubtedly thrifty, and could have stated
blindfolded the exact number of cigars or cigarettes that were
lying about, no matter how apparently negligently.</p>
<p>Lord Alfred had been a yachtsman all his life, and he would
tell how our late Queen&mdash;with that characteristic
woman&rsquo;s tact that never left her&mdash;wrote <a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>to him on
the occasion of a former yacht being run down by a Channel mail
packet, &ldquo;You must not be ashamed to accept the enclosed
&pound;500 as a gift from the Sovereign to a subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mighty different woman now,&rdquo; he would add,
pouting his lips, and then toddling off with a six-foot telescope
to take the harmless bearings of any &ldquo;poppits&rdquo; within
hail.</p>
<p>His chum &ldquo;Alec&rdquo; was a charming man, and when he
and Lionel Brough&mdash;as on one occasion&mdash;began capping
one reminiscence by another on the deck of the <i>Santa Maria</i>
the show was as good as anything to be seen at the Opera Comique
or Strand, or any of the various theatres of which he was
lessee.&nbsp; Years before he had married Lydia Thompson, a name
that conveys nothing to the present generation, but who in the
sixties was the cleverest and prettiest of burlesque actresses,
and there was not a youngster worth his salt that was not
desperately in love with her.&nbsp; Lydia Thompson was aunt to
Violet Cameron, who attained a certain position in the later
seventies at the Strand, but was overshadowed by Florence St.
John, one of the very few who, in addition to being the most chic
of actresses, possessed a pure and cultivated voice.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">USURERS AND MILLIONAIRES.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> &ldquo;Purchase&rdquo; was in
full blast the chosen race had some data to go upon as regards
the &ldquo;possibilities&rdquo; of their clients, who for the
most part were Army men, and when the mystic P appeared after a
name in the Army List, they felt fairly safe that their
investments were recoverable; many, however, found to their cost
that &ldquo;charging&rdquo; one&rsquo;s commission was not
recognised by the Horse Guards, and that despite the production
of a sackful of mortgages, Cox dared not part with a cent of the
commission money to any one but the actual reprobate.&nbsp;
Barely had a name appeared in the <i>Gazette</i> when a squad of
these harpies hustled each other before the modest portals in
Craig&rsquo;s Court, and &ldquo;the widows of Asher were loud in
their wail&rdquo; when they heard that their co-religionists had
been turned empty away.&nbsp; In the citadel itself they, of
course, had numerous paid spies, who &ldquo;posted&rdquo; them as
to any imminent appearance in the <i>Gazette</i>, and no one
earned more shekels by this illicit traffic than a clerk, who
eventually had to leave, but who may still be seen shambling
about Leicester Square in the futile endeavour to raise small
loans for his shoddy client&egrave;le.&nbsp; In pot-houses that
he &ldquo;uses&rdquo; he is known as &ldquo;the Captain,&rdquo;
and affects the old dragoon limp.&nbsp; For the human species, as
everybody is aware, is composed but of two distinct races: the
men who borrow, and the men who lend; <a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>under which two original diversities
may be reduced all those impertinent classifications we are
familiar with, such as Celtic and Gothic origin, white men, black
men, red men, and such like.&nbsp; It is of the latter class
during the sixties we propose to speak.</p>
<p>At the head of the list was Callisher&mdash;known in the
family as Julius&mdash;then followed Bob Morris
(&ldquo;Jellybelly&rdquo;) and a bad third was Sam Lewis, only
then emerging from the status of a traveller in cheap jewellery,
who addressed one as &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; and ready at a
moment&rsquo;s notice to produce a ten-pound note and draw out a
bill for &pound;15, with which his pockets were invariably
lined.</p>
<p>An undoubtedly leading usurer of the sixties was Bob Morris,
who&mdash;it was no secret&mdash;was originally financed by Sir
Henry De Hoghton, an eccentric baronet referred to
elsewhere.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jellybelly,&rdquo; as he was familiarly
known, transacted business in the vicinity of the Raleigh.&nbsp;
A noiseless bell in a blaze of brass, and a door that opened
without any visible agency, were the first objects that struck
one on the threshold of the outer world.&nbsp; Introduced first
into an ante-room, a client&mdash;subject to satisfactory
scrutiny&mdash;was filtered into the presence of the great
man.</p>
<p>No indecent hurry was permitted during these important
preliminaries, and one might as reasonably have hoped to enter
the library of a bishop as to approach Bob Morris without a
scrupulous regard to decorum.</p>
<p>Numerous applicants were to be found at all hours in meek and
becoming attitudes waiting for the moving of the waters, some to
be rebuffed by deputy, and others only to be admitted and
immediately bowed out.</p>
<p>A second waiting-room above relieved the congestion of the one
below when unusual circumstances taxed its resources; it was
heavily curtained, dark, on Turkish bath lines, and it was
considered a bad <a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>sign&mdash;as the precursor to a snub&mdash;when one
was promoted to this retreat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jellybelly&rdquo; was strictly honourable according to
his lights; if he could get 100 per cent. he preferred it to 80,
and if 80 was not forthcoming he would accept 60 on the security
of the Consols.&nbsp; The variety of his transactions would have
embarrassed a less brilliant mind, and at one time or another he
had found himself owner (by mortgage) of the three first
favourites for the Derby, the foundations and a partially
completed wing of a skating-rink, and two miles of a submarine
tunnel on which work had been stopped.&nbsp; That such
multifarious responsibilities might reasonably be supposed to tax
the patience of an ordinary mortal would have been matter of no
surprise, but nothing appeared to give him the least concern.</p>
<p>It was Sam Lewis&rsquo;s pluck that obtained him the colossal
fortune he eventually died possessed of, and, ever ready to run
the most infernal risks, it was seldom he did not come out
top.&nbsp; During Goodwood week he did business in his bedroom at
the &ldquo;Grand,&rdquo; and a telegram from the other end of the
kingdom, followed by an acceptance, invariably produced banknotes
by return post.</p>
<p>It was only after he began to feel his legs and to dabble in
title deeds, that he abandoned the genial habits of his youth,
became <i>Mr.</i> Lewis, could be seen only by appointment, and
assumed an expression between that of a bank director and an
Egyptian sphinx.</p>
<p>When I &ldquo;met&rdquo; him first he was not above a swap,
and a bill for, say, &pound;50, paid in &pound;20 cash and the
balance in tawdry gimcracks, was the usual style of
transaction.&nbsp; At the time I refer to he lived in an
unpretentious house in Gower Street; later on, as a younger
generation are aware, he possessed a mansion in Grosvenor Square;
rode in the Park at daylight during the <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>Season, and
gave dinner parties where any one from a member of the Victorian
Order upwards was always assured of a hearty welcome.&nbsp; So
keen, indeed, was the little man (or his wife) to be considered
members of the fringe of Society that an enterprising young
man&mdash;related to the noble House of Somerset&mdash;was
unquestionably on a fixed scale of remuneration, and given
<i>carte blanche</i> to bring any sprig of nobility at prices
ranging from a guinea upwards.&nbsp; In addition, a few minor
under-strappers, such as the late lamented Patty Coleman and
others, had a free hand to produce &ldquo;desirables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little man&mdash;as we all know&mdash;is now a matter of
history, his widow not long after again married and then followed
him, though her memory is still cherished in the Synagogue as
&ldquo;Lewis of the Guards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the smaller fry, Fitch of Southwark; Sol Beyfus; Finney
Davis of Mount Street; Lazarus of Dublin; Cook of Warwick Street,
all assisted in spoiling the Egyptians; whilst their sons, almost
without exception, have risen in the minor social scale as
attorneys or chartered accountants, and their sons will assuredly
figure in &ldquo;Debrett&rsquo;s&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Landed
Gentry,&rdquo; as instanced in a glaring case, where a railway
navvy&mdash;who left his three sons a million sterling each in
the Sixties&mdash;we are now informed in the peerage was
undoubtedly descended from de&mdash;, who came over with the
Conqueror, and that his genealogy is lost in antiquity&mdash;not
always an unmixed evil.</p>
<p>In the old days the usurer used his own name, now they cull
the peerage for the most historical they can find.&nbsp; But</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Brown, Jones, or Moses<br />
Can change their names but not their noses.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps no more marvellous example of Nature&rsquo;s constant
care for the wants of her needy creations is to be found than in
the periodical appearance above the horizon of some nobody who,
having amassed <a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>a colossal fortune, is henceforth ordained by a
merciful Providence to rescue impecunious lords from the slough
of despair, level-up princes who have exceeded their income, and
to put upon their legs livery stablemen; authorities on
horseflesh and their superiors generally by birth and
education.</p>
<p>In the long-ago Sixties these providential phenomena were not
appreciated as much as in these more enlightened days, and, even
in such sinks of iniquity as Mott&rsquo;s, an impecunious
gentleman was assessed as a considerably more desirable quantity
than knighted shop-boys, &ldquo;H&rdquo;-less capitalists, or
promoted horse copers.</p>
<p>That even then they existed goes without saying; that they did
not assist in making history is equally undeniable.</p>
<p>Amongst these one of the most remarkable was one
Hirsch&mdash;Baron of somewhere&mdash;but whose untimely death
before he attained to Debrett makes his genealogy difficult to
trace with any degree of accuracy.&nbsp; Suddenly springing into
prominence, he at once broke out into horseflesh; and although
probably not knowing one end of a horse from another, soon
collected a magnificent stud, and being surrounded by
disinterested! councillors of the highest attainments, soon swept
the board in most of the classic races.&nbsp; But the subject
that brought him chiefly into prominence was his solicitude for
his co-religionists: first, he proposed to buy Jerusalem, but
meeting with obstacles that even money could not overcome, he
contemplated a &ldquo;personally-conducted tour,&rdquo; whereby
the Holy City should again become the habitation of the chosen
race.&nbsp; But his premature death, alas! nipped all these
aspirations in the bud, and the gimcrack shops in Bond Street
still flourish, and the successors of Callisher, Bob Morris, and
Sam Lewis continue to batten on Christian flesh.&nbsp; The sums
that he expended and bequeathed on this desirable <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>object were
not without significance, and the leaves of the Talmud were
ransacked to show that he was the undoubted 666, or some equally
unintelligible hieroglyphic that had been predicted by the
Prophets; and then death entered Bath House and snapped the
various theories&mdash;<i>Quod erat demonstrandum</i>.</p>
<p>Baron de Forest, whom we occasionally hear of as one of the
shining lights of modern Society, inherited a considerable
portion of the deceased &ldquo;nobleman&rsquo;s&rdquo; fortune,
and is said to be related to him.</p>
<p>A phenomenon of another type was Colonel North.&nbsp; Soldier,
philanthropist, and nitrate expert, it matters not what regiment
had the privilege of being commanded by him; it was in the latter
industry that he endeared himself to his species.&nbsp; Liberal,
bluff, and accessible to all, his daily free lunches at the
&ldquo;Woolpack&rdquo; were partaken of by all the halt and the
maim&mdash;and occasionally the blind&mdash;within the four-mile
radius.</p>
<p>Impecunious Irish lords, with ancestral bogs sadly in need of
re-digging, now saw their opportunity, and a huge industry sprang
into existence, where, for a consideration&mdash;in
shares&mdash;the meteor was introduced to certain higher lords
who, holding broad theories on &ldquo;meum and tuum,&rdquo; in
their turn arranged dinner parties where the most exalted were to
be met with.&nbsp; Often did the rafters of Connaught Place
rattle during these festive gatherings, and sheaves of shares
changed hands till no one was sent empty away, and so by the aid
of nitrate, &ldquo;the Colonel&rdquo; was wafted amid the highest
pinnacles of Society.&nbsp; Occasionally a false note was struck
when some over-eager recipient put his shares on the
market&mdash;but even these <i>faux pas</i> were soon forgotten,
for &ldquo;the Colonel,&rdquo; if not &ldquo;Plantagenet
blood,&rdquo; had the instincts of a gentleman.&nbsp; That the
owner of such vast wealth must needs own racehorses goes without
saying, upon which &rsquo;bus drivers and unsuccessful
authorities on horseflesh <a name="page181"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>came upon the scene, and thus the
sphere of Nature&rsquo;s bountiful providence became more
extended.&nbsp; North, however, never attained prominence in a
pursuit he was probably utterly indifferent to, though his
colours were frequently to be seen (last) at the various race
meetings.</p>
<p>It was a sad day in Bohemia Minor when &ldquo;the
Colonel&rdquo; was gathered to his fathers; and the diminution in
white waistcoats and immaculate attire in Gracechurch Street and
Northumberland Avenue was lamentably apparent; the rockets that
had temporarily fizzled gradually expended themselves, their very
sticks were soon untraceable; straw hats and macintoshes (during
the dog days) gradually resumed their ascendency, and Society
recovered from the topsy-turveydom with which it was once
temporarily threatened.</p>

182</span>CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">SOME CURIOUS FISH OF THE
SIXTIES.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span> Henry De Hoghton, a wealthy
baronet who was above the horizon in the Sixties, though
possessed of a fine estate and a palatial residence, preferred
the hand-to-mouth existence of an hotel, and lived at
Meurigy&rsquo;s, now the supper-house yclept the Chatham.&nbsp;
Never visible to the naked eye by day, he wandered into the
Raleigh about midnight, and casting furtive glances in various
directions, would settle down without a word.&nbsp; To punters he
was a very oasis in a dry land, for, although the very worst
&eacute;cart&eacute; player in Christendom, no stakes were too
high for him, and after losing a game or two his proposals were
literally appalling.</p>
<p>To ask him to play was the signal for his abrupt departure; to
ignore his presence was tantamount to &pound;100 a game within
twenty minutes.</p>
<p>Fred Granville, who about this period was considerably out of
his depth, had a peculiar experience with him.&nbsp; On one
occasion, having lost to the eccentric baronet some &pound;3,000,
De Hoghton, who evidently knew that a settlement was precarious,
said, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go to
&lsquo;Jellybelly&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What occurred at the suggested interview it is difficult to
arrive at, but within the week it was generally known that De
Hoghton financed the Hebrew money-lender, and by such
disinterested advice as <a name="page183"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 183</span>above was invariably paid, leaving
the onus of recovery to the astute Bob Morris.</p>
<p>Another drunken baronet who lived in Eaton Square, and had
married an houri of a very inferior type, had for his chief hobby
the surrounding himself with pugilists and comic singers.</p>
<p>Living entirely on the ground floor, the drawing-room, which
was carpetless, was got up like a cockpit.&nbsp; Here nightly
orgies were held, to the annoyance of every one within hearing,
and when too much port&mdash;with which the cellars were
filled&mdash;had done its duty, rows were not infrequent between
this disreputable couple.&nbsp; On one occasion I can recollect
her drunken ladyship&mdash;very lightly clad&mdash;ordering a
powdered six-foot flunkey to put out the lights instantly, and
her drunken spouse&rsquo;s rejoinder, &ldquo;If you dare to touch
a candle, you leave my house this moment.&rdquo;&nbsp; After
which a domestic scrimmage and a stampede ensued, and, seizing
hats and coats, the guests hurriedly departed.</p>
<p>An eccentric old lady who died about this time left her large
fortune to a distant relative on the condition that she was never
to be put below earth.</p>
<p>To obviate the slightest risk of losing the legacy, the astute
recipient immediately purchased a house in London, and with all
the pomp worthy of the occasion, placed the mass of corruption,
securely boxed, on the roof, after which it was soldered on to
the leads and encased in a glass shade.</p>
<p>The eyesore has long disappeared, but twenty years ago it was
an object of interest to strollers in Kensington Gardens.</p>
<p>Ned Deering was a well-known figure in Pall Mall in the
long-ago Sixties.&nbsp; The heir to one of the oldest baronetcies
in the kingdom, he distorted his handsome features by wearing his
hair down to his shoulders in imitation of Charles I. (of blessed
memory), whom he imagined he resembled.</p>
<p><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>Eccentric to a degree, he married a few years later the
lady known to posterity as Mrs. Bernard Beere, and great was the
consternation in Kent lest a &ldquo;small Beer&rdquo; might
eventually be enrolled in their local patrician ranks; but the
scare was short-lived, and Ned, who meanwhile had turned
Papist&mdash;as he would have turned Mohammedan had he lived in
Morocco&mdash;died in a picturesque cottage with garden in front
in Jermyn Street, imbibing buckets of champagne to the last, and
with the encouraging assurance of a sure and joyful
resurrection.&nbsp; The spot is now represented by the back
entrance of the Criterion Theatre.&nbsp; No more amusing
companion existed than Ned Deering, when the spirit moved
him.</p>
<p>Amongst military characters, Lord Mark Kerr must assuredly be
given the palm.&nbsp; Of overwhelming family interest, he ruled
the 13th Somersetshire Light Infantry as a veritable
despot.&nbsp; Mad as any March hare, he frequently appeared on
parade with his shako reverse-ways on his head, and if his
eagle-eye spotted some awkward-looking recruit, he would paralyse
him by, &ldquo;Ha! you come from Bath, eh?&nbsp; I suppose you
consider yourself a Bath brick?&nbsp; But I consider you a
Bath&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; In the mess, too, he was equally
harmlessly autocratic, and no officer was expected to take his
seat till Lord Mark had said, &ldquo;Be seated,
gentlemen.&rdquo;&nbsp; But there was no vice in this eccentric
branch of the house of Lothian.&nbsp; Whether he would have been
tolerated in these later days is another affair.</p>
<p>Major Francis, who was on the Smoking Room Committee of the
Turf Club, was an admitted authority on cigars.&nbsp; Small in
stature, the little man carried a cigar-case in every pocket of
his numerous coats; not a cigar entered the docks but was sampled
as a labour of love for the large importers by this
unquestionable expert.&nbsp; And often have I accompanied him to
St. Mary Axe, where box after box has been <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>opened, and
cigar after cigar lighted for our delectation, only to be laid
aside after one whiff as we passed on to other brands.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But what becomes of all these wasted samples?&rdquo; I
inquired of Mr. Dodswell.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not
wasted,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;they become &lsquo;Regalia
Britannicas,&rsquo; such as these,&rdquo; and he handed me a
gilt-edged box of the most approved pattern that might well
deceive any but an expert.</p>
<p>Major Francis created a revolution in the cigars that were
supplied at the Turf, and instead of the &ldquo;Golden
Eagles&rdquo; such as Dicky Boulton considered cheap at three
shillings apiece, and others assessed as dear at any price, the
finest exports of the Havanas were to be had for less than half
the money.</p>
<p>Every youngster aspiring to importance in those days affected
the possession of countless thousands of two-shilling cigars, and
the walls of a large establishment in Bond Street were covered
with boxes bearing in conspicuous type the various names and
designations.</p>
<p>It may be stated, however, that the venture was a
&ldquo;credit&rdquo; one, which, whilst pandering to the vanity
of the owner, in no way injured the tradesman, who delicately
withdrew any surplus stock where settlement appeared
doubtful.</p>
<p>Lord Alexander Russell&mdash;a brother of the Duke of
Bedford&mdash;when in command of the Rifle Brigade invariably
smoked a short clay when at the head of his regiment, and Colonel
Warden, another eccentric, who commanded the 19th Foot, seldom
rose till one or two in the afternoon, and would keep the whole
regiment dangling about the orderly room for hours, to the
amusement of the rest of the camp.</p>
<p>But this was in the days when every regiment was a
principality ruled by a despot, who, twice a year at most,
underwent formal inspection by some amiable old gentleman, who
received &pound;600 a year for wearing a cocked hat as commander
of such and such a regiment.</p>
<p><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>That
the state of preparedness that often then existed would hardly
meet the requirements of the present-day alertness may best be
exemplified by what I once assisted at.</p>
<p>The Inspecting General was Sir Percy Douglas, who had
expressed the desire of seeing and hearing that instructive
man&oelig;uvre, a <i>feu de joie</i>.&nbsp; Proudly did the
commanding officer give the requisite command, and with one
accord 800 muzzle-loading barrels pointed defiantly heavenwards;
then pop here, pop there a hundred yards down the line, a charge
here and there exploded.</p>
<p>Every barrel was choked with mutton fat&mdash;a favourite
recipe against rust amongst the old warriors of England.</p>
<p>Some startling stories of the mad Marquis of Waterford might
be introduced, if their production were possible.&nbsp; One or
two incidents, however, of the Sixties may not be amiss.&nbsp;
Constantly was this privileged lunatic to be seen walking the
Haymarket at breakneck speed, and being known to every cabman,
waterman, and policeman, his antics attracted little
attention.&nbsp; On one occasion he appeared in an exceptionally
dishevelled condition, and a constable remonstrating with him in
a friendly tone, he produced a large knife, and, hacking off what
purported to be a finger, threw it into the street.</p>
<p>His lordship had apparently been exploiting the shambles, and
brought away a blade-bone for possible emergency.</p>
<p>On another occasion he had been annoyed by being overcrowded
in a railway carriage, and retaliated a few days after by
appearing at the station with a chimney-sweep in full canonicals,
for whom he purchased a first-class ticket, and whom he took with
him into the carriage.&nbsp; His lordship and his companion were
on this occasion in no way incommoded.</p>
<p>Sir Charles Ross, a wealthy Highland baronet, <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>visited
London every season for exactly fourteen days, accompanied by a
gillie.&nbsp; At the old &ldquo;Tavistock,&rdquo; where he
invariably stayed, his daily meals consisted of mutton chops and
steaks; his gillie, by express order, was to be given
&ldquo;anything&rdquo;&mdash;salmon and grouse were good enough
for him.</p>
<p>On one occasion he imagined he had dropped a sixpence in the
entrance-hall, and half the staff of the hotel were employed for
two hours at half-a-crown an hour, with express orders to
<i>find</i> it.</p>
<p>A substitute was eventually found, and the routine of the
establishment resumed its normal condition.</p>
<p>Some years later his eccentricities assumed a more serious
form, and having nearly frightened an old woman out of her life
by suddenly rising in his birthday suit with his ribs painted
black from among furze bushes, he was placed under restraint,
and, I believe, died in a madhouse.</p>
<p>Lord Ernest Bruce, who eventually blossomed into Marquis of
Ailesbury, had a chronic deafness that apparently descended to
his sons&mdash;&ldquo;The Duffer,&rdquo; long since dead, and the
present holder of the title (Henry)&mdash;and it was better than
any play to see the father and two sons narrating anecdotes to
one another, with their hands to their respective ears, and
bellowing like fog-horns, and then roaring like rhinoceroses as
their jokes permeated their skulls over the family gatherings
that periodically took place at Boodle&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>At this time an excellent foreign restaurant had made its
appearance in a side street of Soho, and many of the foreign
attach&eacute;s gave it their (private) patronage.</p>
<p>A joke that obtained was the scrambling for coppers from the
window of a private room, and it was on one occasion when Baron
Spaum was revelling in the excitement that the crowds became so
dense that an appeal from the landlord necessitated a resort to a
ruse.</p>
<p><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>A
suitable (!) person who was dining in the public room kindly
consented to don the Baron&rsquo;s light overcoat and to scramble
coppers that had been provided as he leisurely left the
premises.&nbsp; The deception succeeded admirably, as the crowd
followed the supposed benefactor.&nbsp; The assumption of the
Baron&rsquo;s coat was also a profound success, at least so all
but the Baron agreed.&nbsp; He never saw his paletot again.</p>
<p>An old member of the Conservative, who was well known during
the Sixties and Seventies, made it an invariable practice to sip
brown sherry for two or three hours every afternoon.&nbsp; So
monotonous were the constant applications to his pocket that he
directed the total should be paid in one instalment before he
left.</p>
<p>Fifteen and twenty glasses were the old toper&rsquo;s average,
but on one occasion when his consumption amounted to twenty-five,
he fixed a glazed eye on the footman, and gurgled out: &ldquo;Ten
probable, eighteen possible, but twenty-five,
<i>never</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; After which he paid up, and toddled
into the attendant four-wheeler.</p>
<p>It was during the sixties that Mr. Justice Maule was in the
zenith of his fame.&nbsp; Devoted to his profession, and to the
old port of his Inn, no dinner of his brother benchers would have
appeared complete without the adjunct of his beaming countenance,
when, having stowed away three bottles under his belt, he would
&ldquo;tack&rdquo; the few yards to his chambers in Paper
Buildings, and hang a man in the morning with the decorum only to
be attained by experience.</p>
<p>It was after one of these festive gatherings that Paper
Buildings was burnt to the ground.&nbsp; The Judge, it appears,
was a great reader; whether he always understood what he read (or
did) under given circumstances is not quite clear, suffice that,
having popped into bed and adjusted a vase conveniently on a
chair, he proceeded to place a moderator lamp under his couch,
after which the only reliable evidence <a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>obtainable
was that the old gentleman woke with a start to find himself
enveloped in flames.</p>
<p>As he himself described it, he thought he was dead and that he
had <i>not</i> been carried to Abraham&rsquo;s bosom.&nbsp; He
never, indeed, got over the shock, and, moderating his partiality
for old port, he exhibited more serious tendencies, and so good
came out of evil, and the occupiers of the present palatial
chambers are indebted to Mr. Justice Maule for having gone to bed
tipsy and burnt down the crazy old buildings.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Maule had a grim humour of his own, and Serjeant
Ballantine used to tell of how on one occasion during the
Guildford Assizes a murder case hinged on the evidence of a child
to which the Crown attached importance, but to which the prisoner
vehemently objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, my little girl,&rdquo; said his
lordship.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, if you were to tell a story do you
know where you would go to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; was the candid reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I,&rdquo; was the judicial endorsement;
&ldquo;an excellent answer; swear the witness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But that was before the &ldquo;shock&rdquo; that brought him
to his senses.</p>
<p>Every Army man in the sixties will remember George
Goddard.&nbsp; A cheery Irishman, full of anecdotage, universally
popular, but, alas! with the proverbial lack of the one thing
needful.&nbsp; Appointed by Tod Heatly as one of his touts, he
combined business with pleasure by radiating between the various
regiments and billeting himself on any one he knew at the Raleigh
or Army Clubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Major,&rdquo; he once said to Gussy Brown after a
hilarious mess dinner, &ldquo;you see that stain on the
floor?&nbsp; I bet you I&rsquo;ll remove it without touching
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; replied the little man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet a fiver you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and before
the astonished audience <a name="page190"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 190</span>could say &ldquo;Jack
Robinson&rdquo; the gallant Gussy had been seized by his spurs
and smeared across the floor.</p>
<p>But all this was in the days of practical joking.</p>
<p>Gussy Brown, although the most diminutive of cavalry field
officers, was also the most pompous, and on one occasion when the
4th were invited to a humdrum dance at Brighton the little man,
to show his displeasure, walked slowly round the room with his
&ldquo;Gibus&rdquo; under his arm, and making three stately bows
to the astonished hostess slowly left the room.</p>
<p>On the occasion of the Goddard joke, his only remark was,
&ldquo;D&mdash; stupid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this period touting for brewers and wine merchants was the
curse of the Army.&nbsp; Every club contained retired colonels
and others who buttonholed one on every occasion.&nbsp; Before a
troopship entered the harbour a tout came on board with the
pilot; dining at an Army club, the man at the next table inquired
if your regimental canteen was well served; indeed, they
penetrated the most sacred precincts with the pertinacity of a
sandstorm.</p>
<p>As a cranky old general once exclaimed &ldquo;D&mdash; it, I
thought we were safe when militia men were not eligible; but
these touts and store-keepers and bonnet-shop keepers will make
the Rag a den of thieves, by Gad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The association of these respective vocations in the old
warrior&rsquo;s mind was evidently based on the legend that then
obtained that when the captain was inspecting the front rank of
the Tower Hamlets the rear rank was faced about by way of
precaution.</p>
<p>Every one who knew Jonas Hunt must have been astonished to
read that he left over &pound;35,000 at his death a few months
ago.&nbsp; As brave as a lion, he would assuredly&mdash;had he
not been such a rip&mdash;have received the Victoria Cross for
his share in the Balaclava charge, and when he sold out two years
later, he was literally without a shilling, and continued in <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>the same
happy condition for twenty years after&mdash;not that Jonas
stinted himself in anything, on the contrary, he would plunge to
any extent, dunning you if chance made him your creditor, and
forgetting any debt almost as soon as contracted.&nbsp; A bruiser
of no mean class, he invariably suggested a round if any one had
the temerity to remind him.</p>
<p>A highly objectionable individual, whose father was a buggy
master in Calcutta, and actually got a commission in the
&ldquo;Blues&rdquo; till ordered to sell out for writing
anonymous letters to a celebrated beauty of the Sixties not long
since dead, once had the impudence to remind Jonas of a debt, and
was replied to as follows: &ldquo;I should have thought it more
in your line to have written anonymously to my wife, but if you
prefer to settle the matter with your fists I am entirely at your
disposal.&rdquo;&nbsp; The man who procured the retirement of the
anonymous letter-writer was at the time an officer in the Guards,
and though still to be seen radiating between minor restaurants
and 100 per cent. bureaus, has nothing left of his former self
but a fly-blown prefix to his name, and even that has lost its
commercial value amongst Hebrew financiers of shady
enterprises.</p>
<h2><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">SPIRITUALISM AND REALISM.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> craze for
&ldquo;table-turning,&rdquo; &ldquo;spirit-rapping,&rdquo; and
every conceivable trash connected with the occult sciences, was
in full blast in the long-ago Sixties, and old ladies would form
tea parties and sit all day and half through the night at round
tables with their knotty old mittened thumbs pressed convulsively
against those of their neighbours waiting for the moving of the
waters.&nbsp; Lord Ashburton, who lived near Portman Square, was
the arch-priest and arch-culprit that disseminated this
fashionable twaddle, and there was not a spinster in that (then)
highly-fashionable district that did not devour the leaflets that
were periodically issued broadcast by the inspired old
humbug.&nbsp; Occasionally invitations were issued for
s&eacute;ances, when refreshments (more or less light) were
provided to fortify poor human nature against possible unearthly
attacks after the lights had been judiciously lowered.</p>
<p>It was at one of these functions that I on one occasion found
myself, and, possessing in those days an appetite like a
cormorant, was terribly disillusioned after two hours&rsquo;
waiting for the &ldquo;spirits&rdquo; to hear his lordship order
the butler to &ldquo;bring in the urn.&rdquo;&nbsp; (In those
long-ago days tea without an urn the dimensions of a safe was an
absolute impossibility.)&nbsp; Nor did spiritualism end here, for
numerous haunted houses were in the market where apparitions and
unearthly <a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>sounds could be seen and heard and which no one would
rent.</p>
<p>It is the experience of a man I knew intimately that I will
now&mdash;without expressing an opinion&mdash;relate, as far as I
can recollect, in his own words:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Looking for a house with plenty of elbow
room and of reasonable rent, my attention was attracted by a
dilapidated building&mdash;with garden in front and noseless
statues liberally besprinkling it&mdash;situated in the
Marylebone Road.&nbsp; Proceeding to the agent&rsquo;s, I was
considerably surprised by his terms.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
house,&rsquo; he began, &lsquo;has a bad name; no caretaker will
live on the premises.&nbsp; In a word, sir, here&rsquo;s the key,
and if you are willing to occupy it you shall have it rent free
for six months.&rsquo;&nbsp; I at once closed with his offer, and
seeking out a chum&mdash;lately ordained&mdash;we spent the next
night in the haunted house.&nbsp; It was in the dining-room we
proposed to make a first night of it, and barely had we settled
down for a chat when footsteps were distinctly heard in the
hall.&nbsp; &lsquo;Our lantern!&rsquo; I whispered as we
excitedly opened the door.&nbsp; Nothing was to be seen, nothing
to be heard.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; whispered my friend,
&lsquo;I hear something behind me.&rsquo;&nbsp; I heard the sound
also.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; I called out.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; I repeated; but still the
silence of the Catacombs.&nbsp; Then the sound of footsteps
ascending the uncarpeted stairs was unmistakable till they
gradually died away in the attics.&nbsp; A moment of
indescribable stillness followed; a cold blast chilled the very
marrow of our bones, and our lantern went out like the crack of a
pistol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We returned to our armchairs after carefully locking
the door, but we heard no more.&nbsp; And so we sat till welcome
daylight made its appearance, and as the kettle simmered on the
hob and the sound of awakening life made itself manifest in the
Marylebone Road, it seemed impossible to realise the weird
manifestations we had witnessed.</p>
<p><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;&mdash;,&rsquo; said my friend, &lsquo;we
have learnt a terrible experience; Satan has been unloosed
amongst us.&nbsp; Let us pray.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The house has long since been pulled down; majestic flats now
occupy the site, and instead of the sepulchral moans of
disembodied souls the untrained, throaty voice of lovely woman
may be heard shrieking to the accompaniment of a hired piano, and
producing a discord as damnable, if more up-to-date, than ever
was heard in a haunted house.</p>
<p>In Surrey Street there was a house that rumour asserted had
been hermetically sealed, and was not to be re-opened till a
hundred years had passed, where, in the eighteenth century, a
terrible tragedy had occurred during the progress of a bridal
feast, and the distracted bridegroom, rushing out, had commanded
that God&rsquo;s sun should not again settle on the accursed
board till the generation yet unborn was in being.&nbsp; And I
have a vague recollection of having read, years later, a
description of what was seen as the portals were thrown back
after their century of peace, and light and air had percolated
through the room.&nbsp; One can picture the table decked with its
moth-eaten cloth, the piles of dust that represented the viands,
the chairs pushed back in weird array, and the odour of the tomb
that pervaded everything!</p>
<p>To all which, my enlightened twentieth-century reader, there
is probably another side.&nbsp; The whole thing may be an
absolute fable.</p>
<p>In the days before Trade had made those gigantic strides which
have since dumped its votaries amid the once sacred pages of
Debrett, when knights were not as common as blackberries, and the
Victorian Order had not become a terror in the land, when
buttermen sold butter, and furniture-men sold furniture, and
before huge emporiums for the sale of everything had come into
existence, it was &ldquo;bazaars&rdquo; that supplied the maximum
of selection with the <a name="page195"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 195</span>minimum of locomotion, such as
to-day is to be found in the huge caravanserai yclept
&ldquo;Stores&rdquo; and in Tottenham Court Road and Westbourne
Grove in particular.</p>
<p>In Soho Square, on the western side, where to-day&mdash;and
all day&mdash;men with pronounced features, forbidding
countenances, and of usurious tendencies may be seen in a first
floor window exchanging views on the iniquitous restrictions
associated with stamped paper, a bazaar existed in the long-ago
sixties where dogs that squeaked and elephants that wagged their
tails might have been bought by children of tender years who, for
aught we know, may have since been plucked of their last feather
by the vultures that now hover over those happy hunting
grounds.</p>
<p>Turning into Oxford Street there was the Queen&rsquo;s Bazaar,
afterward converted into the Princess&rsquo;s Theatre, still with
us, with its dismal, dingy frontage and limited shelter for
ladies with guttural voices; whilst almost opposite was the
Pantheon, with perhaps the most chequered career of all, having
been, in turn, the National Opera House, the accepted Masquerade
house, a theatre, and a bazaar till 1867, when it attained its
present proud position as the main tap for the supply of
Gilbey&rsquo;s multifarious vintages.</p>
<p>Still further west was the St. James&rsquo;s Bazaar, built by
Crockford, and soon converted into a hell, where more monies
changed hands and more properties were sold than in all the other
bazaars in the universe.</p>
<p>But perhaps the most tenacious of life was the Baker Street
Bazaar.&nbsp; In its spacious area was situated an unpretentious
shop (since spread half up the street) with two or three windows
in Baker Street, while on the hinterland was the bazaar, and over
it Tussaud&rsquo;s Waxworks.&nbsp; Entering from King Street was
the area occupied annually by the Cattle Show, whilst still
further space was available&mdash;as we were lately informed by
the police reports&mdash;for empty coffins, <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>false
beards, volatile dukes, lead and bricks in bulk, sleeping and
reception rooms, scores of flunkeys, and addenda too multifarious
to mention.&nbsp; Never having seen the subterranean Duke nor the
bewhiskered Druce, one may be permitted to marvel where all this
ghastly conglomeration found shelter, and whether the confusion
that must have occurred amongst the Dutch dukes, the English
shopmen, the cattle, and the Waxworks can in any way be held
responsible for the startling contradictions with which we have
lately been regaled.</p>
<p>But does any one who traverses the historic area between Soho
Square and Charing Cross give a thought to the interest that once
clustered round where Crosse and Blackwell&rsquo;s factory now
stands?&nbsp; Does any one realise whilst &ldquo;held up&rdquo;
in a broken-down &ldquo;Vanguard&rdquo; in Shaftesbury Avenue
that the neighbourhood once echoed with the Royalist battle-cry
&ldquo;So-ho&rdquo; in the days of that greatest of
Englishmen&mdash;Cromwell?&nbsp; Does any one ever give it a
thought that Charing Cross was not so very long ago a resort of
footpads, and that even so late as the Sixties the sweet waters
of the somewhat putrid Thames oozed and bubbled where the
District railway station now stands?&nbsp; And how few are aware
that, when Drummond&rsquo;s Bank was in course of construction,
fossils of mammoth, cave lions, rhinoceros, and Irish deer were
found; and that in future ages, excavations will probably unearth
skeletons of hybrids we all try to dodge and whom naturalists
will describe as voracious, living on suction, apt to beg,
borrow, or steal, migratory to a limited extent, and usually to
be met with between Charing Cross and St. Paul&rsquo;s or on the
plateaus that abut on the Criterion?</p>
<p>As an observant judge once remarked to one of these pariahs
who filled up his cup of iniquities by snatching a fowl from a
confiding poulterer&rsquo;s, &ldquo;God has given you
intelligence; your parents have given <a name="page197"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>you a good education; your country
has provided you with excellent prospects both for the present
and future, instead of which you go about stealing
ducks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passing still further west along the Strand, the changes of
time and idea become more apparent as one contemplates that
stronghold of Christianity&mdash;Exeter Hall&mdash;plastered with
bills and lately passed into alien hands; and the period, the
surging crowd, all lend themselves to the illusion, and one might
almost fancy one heard the echo of 1,000 years ago, &ldquo;Not
this man, but Barabbas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, the irony of Fate! methought; truly does Time turn the old
days to derision; and one knows not whither one&rsquo;s
vapourings might have landed one as a zealous constable fixed his
official eye upon the stoic who, deeming it advisable to
&ldquo;move on,&rdquo; sought consolation, but found none, in an
adjoining tobacconist&rsquo;s by indulging in one of Salmon and
Gluckstein&rsquo;s real Havanas (five for a shilling).</p>
<p>Skimming (not wading through) the report of the Court of
Inquiry lately dragging its monotonous length in the vicinity of
the Chelsea embankment, one was struck by the change that has
come over these senseless preliminaries, which occasionally end
in smoke and sometimes in legalised military or civil
tribunals.&nbsp; For such courts are as old as the hills, and are
convened on every possible excuse.&nbsp; If a soldier loses a
shoebrush it is (or was) a Court of Inquiry that established the
interesting fact; if an officer was accused of a more heinous
offence, it was a Court of Inquiry that heard what was to be
said.</p>
<p>The only difference is that, whereas the old style cost no
more than a few sheets of foolscap and the unnecessary lumbering
of regimental records, the identical luxury cannot now be
indulged in without an array of Old Bailey lawyers, who harangue
the old warriors that constitute the court for hours, utterly
oblivious of the fact that they are better judges of <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>things
military, and not likely to be carried away by those bursts of
eloquence that so impress the twelve jack-puddings of which our
bulwarks and liberties are said to be composed.</p>
<p>The earliest of these Courts of Inquiry was in &rsquo;41, when
Lord Cardigan killed Captain Tucket in a duel&mdash;and ended in
his trial and acquittal by his brother peers.</p>
<p>Later on, in &rsquo;44, Lord William Paget and the same
bellicose Earl had a domestic squabble in which the former said
&ldquo;he had,&rdquo; and the latter said &ldquo;he
hadn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and this began by a Court of Inquiry and
culminated in the High Court.</p>
<p>Again, in &rsquo;54 Lieutenants Perry and Greer were hailed
before a Court of Inquiry for practical jokes of a pronounced
character, but the inquiry ended in smoke, as it was
&ldquo;revised&rdquo; by the Minister of War.</p>
<p>In &rsquo;61 was the Court of Inquiry in the 4th Dragoon
Guards which, disclosing undoubted bullying on the part of
Colonel Bentinck (the present Duke of Portland&rsquo;s father),
ended in a court martial, when nothing but interest saved the old
gentleman&rsquo;s bacon.</p>
<p>Later on, there was the Mansfield affair, when a disagreement
arose between Sir William Mansfield (afterwards Lord Sandhurst),
or his wife, and an aide-de-camp that elicited much that was
amusing in regard to purloined jams and other preserves, for
which her ladyship was supposed to be celebrated; all which
instances ended in the usual way after an infinity of positive
assertion met by flat contradiction.</p>
<p>Whether the farce lately enacted, with its lawyers and their
speeches, affected the result, or benefited anybody except the
lawyers, is a point upon which most people will agree; all which,
however, sinks into insignificance in comparison with the
question as to when and how did this interference with <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>military
tribunals first become tolerated, and how can our Military
Council or our Military anything, or the officers constituting
the Court, submit to be harangued by &ldquo;only a
civilian,&rdquo; as one of Robertson&rsquo;s plays describes
outsiders?</p>
<p>In all the military tribunals of the past such an innovation
was unheard of.&nbsp; Colonel Crawley, on his trial, had words
put into his mouth by Sir William Harcourt (whose reputation as
an orator it made), but he was not permitted to address the
Court.&nbsp; In the Robertson Court Martial it was the same, and
in the Navy to-day a prisoner is defended by &ldquo;a
friend,&rdquo; but no civilian would be permitted to
&ldquo;quarter deck it&rdquo; in that conservative service.</p>
<p>Even Colonel Dawkins&mdash;who, by the way, was a Household
Brigade man&mdash;amongst all his eccentric experiences, never
got so far as suggesting that a civilian should bridge the chasm
that has hitherto existed between the Law Courts and the Horse
Guards by all this special pleading, and one wonders what old Sir
George Browne or General Pennefather would have said (or sworn)
if such a suggestion had been proposed to them!&nbsp; It may be
too much to say there would have been an earthquake, but the
foundations of the house would certainly have vibrated.</p>
<p>And it is the ignorance of what the present privileges of the
Guards are that makes it difficult to form any opinion on the
merits of the case.&nbsp; The friction that these
&ldquo;privileges&rdquo; used to cause when a Household regiment
was occasionally brigaded at Aldershot or Dublin or the Curragh
with regiments of the line was, however, undeniable.</p>
<p>It pained old captains with Crimean and Indian medals to be
&ldquo;turned out&rdquo; by a field officer with a fluffy upper
lip and a youthful voice that had not long before sounded at
Eton; it was irritating (at least) for colonels commanding
distinguished regiments to see a Guard&rsquo;s sentry fumbling
with his rifle <a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>and deliberately coming to the &ldquo;carry,&rdquo; and
five minutes after &ldquo;presenting&rdquo; to a brevet major of
the Guards, who was trundling a hoop when the old warrior was in
the trenches before Sebastopol; it was annoying to read in
general orders special reminders as to the prohibition regarding
imperials and capricious shaving, and to see half-a-dozen Guards
officers with beards like pioneers; it was amusing to hear (as
one did) the son of old Sir Percy Douglas (who was for a little
season in the Guards) inform a distinguished field officer that
the &ldquo;executive&rdquo; command could only be given by a
Guardsman to a Guardsman; and still more amusing to hear the
retort which made mincemeat of the privilege, at least, on that
occasion&mdash;all which nonsense has, however, been considerably
modified.&nbsp; By all means let the Guards retain their
privileges and licences&mdash;but let them in mercy be
&ldquo;consumed on the premises.&rdquo;&nbsp; And if the physique
of these favoured regiments is not as fine as of yore, no one
will deny that their &ldquo;marching past&rdquo; and their
&ldquo;dressing&rdquo; are far superior to that of the line and
&ldquo;pretty&rdquo; enough to please even Admiral Scott
himself.</p>
<p>It may further be conceded without fear of contradiction that
the Queen&rsquo;s Company of the Grenadiers in 1862 was a
magnificent specimen of physique and drilled to perfection under
Lord Henry Percy and Micky Bruce.</p>
<p>Beards, indeed, have always been a cause of offence.&nbsp; In
the tropics (except in India) a man is compelled to shave; with
the thermometer below zero, the same regulation is rigidly
enforced.</p>
<p>It was Colonel Crealock&rsquo;s beard at Gibraltar that was
the indirect cause of an officer being tried by Court Martial; it
was Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar&rsquo;s and Colonel
Phillip&rsquo;s beards that led to invidious remarks in the
Dublin Division; and, until the razor is abolished beyond the
precincts of the four-mile <a name="page201"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 201</span>radius, so long will a link remain
between the grand old days of the muzzle loader and cold steel
and the modern requirements for potting an enemy at a thousand
yards rise.</p>
<p>When the Metropolitan Board of Works was at the zenith of its
power, and thoroughfares were being projected, and whole streets
were disappearing and ancient rookeries being demolished, it was
incredible the leakage that appeared to exist, and how the
friends of indiscreet or dishonest employ&eacute;s reaped a
harvest by acquiring dilapidated buildings for a song, and
standing out for huge compensation when the day for demolition
drew nigh.</p>
<p>An astute former hanger-on at Faultless&rsquo;s cock-pit in
Endell Street surprised me considerably on one occasion as he
stood at the door of a dilapidated beer-house in Covent Garden by
informing me that he had bought it for a trifle, and six months
later I was literally staggered by again meeting the rascal
shovelling out potatoes at a little greengrocery shop where now
stands the London and Westminster Bank opposite the Law
Courts.</p>
<p>He explained that he had a brother in a humble but trusted
position at Spring Gardens, and that his old beer-house had
ceased to exist, and he expected his &ldquo;present
property&rdquo; would &ldquo;come down&rdquo; before long.</p>
<p>Green Street, leading from Leicester Square, was another
channel for the acquisition of large profits, and when every
house was a bug-walk, and demolition a matter of a few months,
the news was actually &ldquo;offered&rdquo; to a man I knew well
able to find the requisite purchase money, but rejected from
misplaced prudential motives.</p>
<p>The present London Pavilion was another glaring instance of
jobbery, and years before it was necessary to hustle the
ex-Scott&rsquo;s waiter from the cosy nest-egg he so diligently
nursed, the Board of Works descended <a name="page202"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 202</span>on him like an avalanche with a
peremptory notice to quit.</p>
<p>At this stage one Villiers comes upon the scene, but whether
he was a scion of the noble house of Jersey or Clarendon is not
clear.&nbsp; Suffice that tradition credited him with having once
been a considerable actor who had made a great hit in a minor
part in the <i>Overland Route</i> at the Haymarket during the
fifties.&nbsp; Later, he appears to have become lessee of the
transpontine Canterbury Hall, where he was a dismal failure, and
spent the latter portion of his tenancy in bed&mdash;a victim of
gout and the importunities of irrepressible bill-stickers.</p>
<p>It was in these darkest hours that the Board of Works entered
into his life, and in an incredibly short space of time he had
enlisted the co-operation of a sporting furrier, had hustled the
unhappy Loibel out, and was in undisputed possession of the
London Pavilion.&nbsp; How the &pound;103,000 was found to pay
the out-going man is of no particular importance, suffice that so
indecent was the haste that an auction was deemed superfluous;
the entire contents were turned over at a valuation, and as
Loibel toddled out Villiers toddled in, and&mdash;undisturbed by
parochial or other demands&mdash;he gradually rose to affluence,
periodically visited Continental watering-places, was a person to
be reckoned with in a mushroom political club, and died recently
worth a considerable personalty.</p>
<p>The juggle over the Pavilion never attracted much interest,
and the gladiators being respectively a German and a Jew the
transaction was forgotten almost at its inception.</p>
<p>Passing through the Opera Colonnade I tried not long ago to
locate the exact shop&mdash;once a cigar
merchant&rsquo;s&mdash;in which the Raleigh, originally known as
the &ldquo;Old Havana Cigar Club,&rdquo; may be said to have had
its being, for it was whilst sitting on tubs one afternoon in the
fifties that three or four Mohawks <a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>of the first order persuaded Tod
Heatly&mdash;the ground landlord&mdash;to provide some sort of
superior night-house which, by opening its doors at 10 p.m. and
not closing them till the last roysterer had reeled home, would
&ldquo;meet a want long felt,&rdquo; as modern advertisements
occasionally describe their worthless wares.</p>
<p>It was later&mdash;in the early seventies&mdash;that the
proprietorship changed hands, and was worked on more commercial
lines by the Brothers Ewen (triplets), who, believing in quantity
rather than quality, periodically sat as a committee under the
chairmanship of an amiable old gentleman (Lord Monson) and
elected everything and everybody capable of producing the
increased subscription.</p>
<p>It was in the solitary long room of the Tod Heatly era that
details were arranged for the duel (which never came off) in
regard to an accusation of foul play that was made in a Pall Mall
club, when an old gentleman, who was in Court dress, was
considerably astonished at receiving a flip on his calf from an
erratic trump.&nbsp; And in this room, too, enough
Justerini&rsquo;s brandy was consumed of a night to float the
motors which now lumber that once-sacred chamber.&nbsp; For
whisky and other emanations of the potato were then practically
unknown and only heard of by the privileged few who had seen an
illicit Boucicault still on the stage.</p>
<p>Proceeding yet further west I passed the College of
Surgeons&mdash;presented by George IV. in a fit of after-dinner
generosity to that distinguished body to be held for all time on
a pepper-corn rent.&nbsp; One can almost picture the burst of
humble gratitude that gushed forth at the gracious act, and the
bland smile that illumined the anointed features at the
consciousness of having done a generous deed without being one
penny the worse for it.&nbsp; It was condescensions such as this
that endeared &ldquo;the first gentleman&rdquo; to a loyal and
dutiful people.&nbsp; And then across the <a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>square,
where Northumberland House once stood, I wondered if one human
being could locate the spot within fifty yards, and whether the
old lion that topped it pointed his tail to the east or west, a
subject on which more bets have been made than ever fell to the
lot of man or beast.</p>
<h2><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>CHAPTER XIX.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE ROCK AND THE CAPE.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> providential success of
Playfair in the Cambridgeshire of &rsquo;72 had released more
than one of our clique from the jaws of the usurer, and Bill
Stourton, by the judicious investment of a fiver, was in
expectation of being the proud owner of &pound;300 on the
following Monday.</p>
<p>Dashing down to Somersetshire overflowing with filial duty and
in anticipation of our early embarkation for Gibraltar, a
considerable scare was created one morning by a groom running up
to the house and reporting that the sheriff&rsquo;s carriage and
two grimy beaks from Taunton had pulled up at the
&ldquo;George&rdquo; and were making tender inquiries as to Mr.
William&rsquo;s whereabouts.</p>
<p>All this occurred on Monday, when, as it happened, Billy was
speeding towards London to realise at Tattersall&rsquo;s the
result of his sagacity at Newmarket.&nbsp; And so, when the
oleaginous visitors inquired at the ancestral porch, the reply
they received was discouraging in the extreme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is Mr. William&rsquo;s bedroom,&rdquo; pointing to
a window, was the ingenuous servitor&rsquo;s reply; &ldquo;you
can go and examine it if you wish; but I give you my word he left
for London this morning.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so it came to pass that
the astute &ldquo;Fitch and Son,&rdquo; of Southwark, failed to
serve the capias, and the rascally Israelite who had made
&ldquo;affidavit&rdquo; as to his intention of &ldquo;leaving the
kingdom&rdquo; (as embarking with <a name="page206"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 206</span>the regiment might certainly be
construed by a quibble) had to pay the cost of the imposing coach
that had been provided for his conveyance to Taunton.</p>
<p>The faithful butler had omitted to add that the young
reprobate was returning the same evening, and that the dog-cart
was to meet him at nine.</p>
<p>But the reprieve was not of long duration, and within a year
Bill had sold his commission and become a full private in the
Blues.</p>
<p>Passing into the Horse Guards one day a former brother officer
chanced to inquire of the sentry the way to the military
secretary&rsquo;s, and was considerably startled by the reply,
&ldquo;First door to the left, Polly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sentry was ex-Lieutenant Stourton.</p>
<p>Gibraltar then&mdash;as now&mdash;was a favourite winter
resort, and the &ldquo;Club House Hotel&rdquo; opposite the main
guard did a roaring trade.</p>
<p>Here Lady Herbert of Lea and her youthful son, the present
Lord Pembroke, sojourned for some weeks in the Sixties, and it
was to the inquiring turn of mind of the young nobleman&rsquo;s
tutor that Gibraltar was almost indebted for a very promising
row.</p>
<p>In one room, it appears, a cantankerous Irishman and his wife
were staying, in the next the tutor, and whilst the Irishman
positively swore he had one morning seen the prying tutor&rsquo;s
face glued to the fanlight as vehemently did the pedagogue swear
on a sack of bibles that he had never glued his nose to a
fanlight in his life.</p>
<p>What there was to peep at was not quite clear, for the
supposed &ldquo;object&rdquo; in any costume was not fair to look
upon, and so after mutual recriminations and mutual apologies the
affair was hushed up, and expectant Gibraltar was robbed of a
lawful excitement.</p>
<p>A fly-leaf that appeared weekly&mdash;why, no one could
explain&mdash;although less original than one might have <a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>wished, yet
possessing a symbolism that was unquestionable, on one occasion
appeared with a verbatim extract from a Spanish paper of the
escapades of an adventurer who was exploiting the neighbourhood
of Madrid.</p>
<p>Weeks apparently had elapsed before it had caught the eye of
our lynx-eyed editor, and one day when Ansaldo invited certain of
us to compare a recent resident at his hotel with the description
in the very latest &ldquo;local intelligence&rdquo; it became
apparent to all that a lately departed wayfarer was the
redoubtable personage referred to.&nbsp; &ldquo;By Jove! I lost
fifty to him last week at loo, and then gave him a
shakedown,&rdquo; remarked one; and, &ldquo;D&mdash;d if I
didn&rsquo;t lend him my horse to go as far as Cadiz, and
it&rsquo;s not to be back till to-morrow,&rdquo; added another;
and then the local tailor came running down to the Club House,
and Ansaldo remembered he had paid his hotel bill by a cheque,
and within a week a dozen victims realised that they had assisted
in one way or another to make the gentleman&rsquo;s Mediterranean
trip a pleasant one.</p>
<p>But money at the Rock was literally a drug, thanks to the
existence of Sacconi, a Genoese grocer.&nbsp; This extraordinary
man was everybody&rsquo;s banker; if one lost at the races it was
Sacconi who settled the account; mess bills were paid by Sacconi;
fifty&mdash;one hundred Isabels&mdash;were only to be asked for
to be obtained by initialling the amount at the shop.</p>
<p>Apparently indifferent to risk, the astute Italian was,
however, working on a certainty.&nbsp; Immediately a regiment was
under orders for the Rock, a list of every officer&rsquo;s
&ldquo;length of tether&rdquo; was transmitted by Perkins, his
London agent, a city knight; whilst, in addition to the value of
one&rsquo;s commission, the impossibility of leaving the Rock
without his knowledge, and the &ldquo;Moorish Castle&rdquo;
frowning on the heights, enabled Sacconi to amass a huge fortune,
<a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>to marry
his daughters to officers of the garrison, and be an honoured
guest in after years at the &ldquo;Convent,&rdquo; the
Governor&rsquo;s official residence.</p>
<p>But all this was in the days of purchase.</p>
<p>Meeting the ex-Governor, Sir William Codrington, one day in
Bond Street on the point of being run over, he jocosely remarked,
as I went to his assistance, &ldquo;Different from Gibraltar,
eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To any but enthusiasts of riding, Gibraltar was (and probably
is) a most overrated station, with nothing to recommend it but
its proximity to London.&nbsp; Every afternoon was devoted to
couples riding to the Cork woods, and returning from its shaded
glades just before gun-fire.</p>
<p>No one ever dreamt of riding with his own wife; indeed, so
accepted was this custom that on one occasion a couple having
been seen riding together, an excited newsmonger rushed about
inquiring, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&nbsp; Holroyd has been seen
riding with his own wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the advent of Fitzroy Somerset gave an immense fillip to
sport, and when, later, six couples of cast hounds came direct
from Badminton every jack-pudding purchased a screw and became an
ardent fox-hunter.</p>
<p>A German apothecary, who had not straddled a quadruped since
he left the Vaterland, became an enthusiastic rider, and thrilled
the less daring horsemen by descriptions of runs, and how
&ldquo;der &rsquo;orse svearved to him right, and I &rsquo;it
&rsquo;im on the &rsquo;ead to his left, and den he svearved to
the left, and I &rsquo;it &rsquo;im on the &rsquo;ead to his
right,&rdquo; till everybody became more or less horsy, and not
to keep a crock with four legs, or three, was tantamount to an
admission that one was literally past praying for.</p>
<p>Every youngster purchased a quadruped&mdash;some vicious and
young, others blind and in the last stage of senile
decay&mdash;and Staines, an assistant surgeon, <a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>was so
frequently sent whirling into space that his animal was
christened &ldquo;Benzine-Collas,&rdquo; because it was
&ldquo;warranted to remove Staines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here, too, was a fox-hunting chaplain known as &ldquo;Tally-ho
Jonah,&rdquo; who ended his days as shepherd of a peculiarly
desirable flock amidst the rich pastures of the Midlands.</p>
<p>On his death-bed some years ago, his valet consoled him with
the assurance that he was going to a better land, to which the
worthy divine replied: &ldquo;John, there&rsquo;s no place like
old England.&rdquo;&nbsp; R.I.P.</p>
<p>But the mania by no means ended here, and Grant, the Principal
Medical Officer&mdash;a bony Scot with the largest feet ever
inflicted on man&mdash;literally paralysed a group who one day
saw him in the distance leisurely approaching on horseback.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great heavens!&rdquo; was the universal exclamation as
he came nearer, &ldquo;why, it&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Benzine-Collas&rsquo; going as quiet as a lamb,&rdquo; and
it was agreed that the fiery little Mogador stallion was being
imposed upon by old Grant, under the impression that he was
between the shafts.</p>
<p>Across the bay was Tangier, and many found an inexhaustible
store of delight in visiting that most Oriental of towns.</p>
<p>Within four days of Paris, it seemed incredible that here was
a spot that civilisation had apparently overlooked, and which
still retained all the barbaric pomp of a thousand years
ago.&nbsp; Fowls with their throats cut lay about the streets
awaiting preparation for pilau; malefactors for the most trifling
offences had their hands hacked off in the leading thoroughfares;
whilst under the windows of the Sherif of Wazan&rsquo;s palace
half a dozen naked musicians blew their insides out from morning
to night, and discoursed a series of diabolical sounds that made
the contemplation of anything but their music impossible.</p>
<p>Here Martin&mdash;late messman of the <i>Racoon</i>&mdash;had
<a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>started
the &ldquo;Royal Hotel,&rdquo; and after providing his visitors
with an excellent dinner, favoured them with morceaux on a flute,
of which he prided himself on being a virtuoso.</p>
<p>Martin was as black as the blackest hat, and from the
suspicious slits in his ears justified the assumption that he was
a liberated West Indian slave.&nbsp; The music he emitted with
eyes closed, possibly the most soulful, was certainly the most
doleful, and had evidently been picked up when watching the
anchor being weighed on H.M.S. <i>Racoon</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you come from, Martin?&rdquo; on one occasion
inquired an inquisitive officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Devonshire,&rdquo; was the unexpected reply; &ldquo;but
I left home in my infancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had made this assertion so often that there is no doubt he
believed it.</p>
<p>Returning from Tangier on one occasion, I brought with me a
quantity of Kuss-Kuss cloth, which catching the eye of a
voracious brother subaltern he inquired where I had got it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;the Sherif of Wazan sent it
over for distribution in return for the guard of honour we
supplied last month when he was here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m entitled to some?&rdquo; he
remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s all been claimed,&rdquo; I
replied, and to keep up the illusion I got half a dozen
youngsters to cross and re-cross the square with a piece under
their arms and deposit it somewhere, for another to fetch it and
leave it elsewhere.&nbsp; It seemed, indeed, that the traffic was
never to end, and next morning an official complaint was made by
the aggrieved one, and he discovered he had been the victim of a
practical joke.</p>
<p>Apropos of this class of grumbler, an amusing story was once
told me by the captain of a P. and O.&nbsp; It was in the days
that the skipper &ldquo;messed&rdquo; the passengers, and it was
this officer&rsquo;s habit to have a <a name="page211"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 211</span>saucerful of porridge every morning
about seven on the bridge.</p>
<p>The feeding on a P. and O. is proverbially liberal, yet not
content with the enormous breakfast provided, certain grumblers
complained that considering the price they paid they surely were
entitled to porridge.&nbsp; Inwardly chuckling, the skipper
reluctantly consented, with the result (as he told me) that
instead of devouring two mutton chops, eggs, and marmalade <i>ad
libitum</i> at eight, he was a considerable gainer by the
satisfying effect of two-pennyworth of porridge at seven.</p>
<p>During my two years at Gibraltar cholera appeared, and
anything more terrible than such a visitation in such a
circumscribed spot can hardly be conceived.&nbsp; With a strict
&ldquo;cordon&rdquo; established, there was no getting away from
it, and men who the night before were in rude health were often
buried at gun-fire.</p>
<p>To be afraid of it was tantamount (so doctors asserted) to
courting it, and so regimental bands were ordered to play daily
on the Alameda by way of diverting the public mind, and not a
drum was heard at the numerous military funerals that wended
their way towards the north front.</p>
<p>By night the &ldquo;corpse-lights&rdquo; over the burial
ground emitted a weird glow, and many a subaltern visiting the
sentries before daylight would shiver and his teeth rattle as he
skirted the unearthly illumination.</p>
<p>To such an extent did downright funk seize upon some that an
officer now living in London&mdash;a C.B. of overwhelming
interest&mdash;asked everybody the best preventive, and jokes
were indulged in at his expense, and he swallowed tablespoonfuls
of salt and raw porpoise liver, as this or the other
prescribed.</p>
<p>Distracted, one afternoon he sought consolation by proceeding
to the house of a fair scorpion (persons born on the Rock) he had
known in happier days, <a name="page212"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 212</span>and literally collapsed as he met
her coffin emerging from her door.</p>
<p>Apropos of this terrible scourge, an instance that many can
vouch for occurred some years previously in India.</p>
<p>My regiment was being decimated by cholera, and corpses were
hurriedly placed in an outhouse that was infested with rats.</p>
<p>The sentries had orders to periodically tap with their rifles
on the door, and on one occasion tapping too hard, the door
opened, and the Armourer Sergeant, who had been brought in a few
hours previously, was seen sitting up on the trestle.</p>
<p>Years after I saw the man daily, and he completed his
twenty-one years&rsquo; service instead of being buried alive, as
many a poor wretch has been.</p>
<p>Colonel Zebulon Pike was by way of being a consul representing
the United States in South Africa and the most amusing liar I
have ever had the good fortune to meet.</p>
<p>The embodiment of generosity, no yarn he ever spun could have
injured a fly; that there never was a word of truth in them was
an accepted axiom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; as he invariably prefixed his remarks,
&ldquo;it was when I was commanding my regiment during the
rebellion that Captain Crusoe reported to me he had captured a
spy.&nbsp; &lsquo;Bring him before me,&rsquo; I said sternly, and
when the rascal appeared I pointed to the sun, saying:
&lsquo;Before yon luminary disappears behind yon hills you
die&rsquo;; and turning to Crusoe, I added: &lsquo;Remove him,
Colonel Crusoe.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Colonel, sir?&rsquo; inquired
he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re
colonel from this very moment.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Colonel once expressed a desire to attend the
Governor&rsquo;s lev&eacute;e; but bewailing the fact that he had
not brought his uniform, he proceeded to describe it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pants, sir, are a rich blue, with a broad lace <a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>stripe down
their sides; my tunic is also blue, and my breast is covered with
medals&mdash;I have a drawerful of them.&nbsp; Around my waist,
sir, is a crimson sash, and in my hat a long ostrich feather
sweeps down to my shoulder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s all easily arranged, Colonel,&rdquo;
we explained, and on the eventful day we proceeded to truss
him.</p>
<p>Never was a more imposing sight, and as the guard of honour
marched down to Government House the Colonel stood on the
pavement, immovable as a rock, with hand to his feathered
billycock.&nbsp; And the men (as had been arranged) came to the
&ldquo;carry,&rdquo; and passed him with all the &ldquo;honours
of war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God, sir, it brought tears to my eyes,&rdquo; he
afterwards told us in his pride, &ldquo;to see yon fine fellows
swinging past; it reminded me of my own regiment.&nbsp; I thank
you, gentlemen, for the compliment you paid a comrade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These colonial lev&eacute;es of the past were often held of an
evening to enable the introduction of refreshments, without which
the attendance would certainly have been meagre.</p>
<p>The local grandees liberally prepared for the coming feast,
and having eaten to repletion proceeded to fill their
pockets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may as well have the sauce,&rdquo; once interposed
an irate A.D.C. as he saw a native pocketing a fowl, and he
deliberately poured the contents of a tureen into his lap.</p>
<p>At these &ldquo;go-as-you-please&rdquo; functions, speeches
more or less impromptu invariably took place, and it was then
that the &ldquo;Colonel&rdquo; was literally in his element.</p>
<p>Panting for his opportunity, it was only after some wag had
proposed his health, and described how we had &ldquo;one amongst
us who had seen the mighty buffalo on its native prairie&rdquo;
(which he assuredly never had), <a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>etc., that the Colonel rose and
delighted his hearers with a string of most amusing lies.</p>
<p>Lady Shand, the wife of the Chief Justice, once sitting near
him, after one of his flowery orations, began to tell him of her
own native home in Scotland, and of the loch that stretched for
miles before the ancestral hall, and was considerably surprised
by the Colonel&rsquo;s rejoinder: &ldquo;Aye, and the swans; I
can see them now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there were no swans, Colonel,&rdquo; she gently
corrected; but henceforth held her peace when the staggering
retort was given: &ldquo;Oh, yes there were; at least, in my
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No function was considered complete without &ldquo;the
Colonel,&rdquo; and he was a frequent guest at one place or
another.&nbsp; Apparently capable of dispensing with sleep, no
matter how late the night&rsquo;s orgy daylight found him on the
verandah with a green cigar, after which he proceeded towards the
Grand river ostensibly to bathe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t do without my morning swim,&rdquo; he once
told a man who met him with a bath-towel over his arm; but the
towel showed no signs of having been used, and it was recognised
that the Colonel never stripped, and that his ablutions were
primitive to a degree.</p>
<p>But the Cape Town of to-day has undergone quite as much change
as our modern Babylon, and where a railway station as big as St.
Pancras now exists, a wooden shanty with a single line fifty
miles long was all that represented railway enterprise in the
long-ago sixties.</p>
<p>It was by the courtesy of Captain Mills, the Assistant
Colonial Secretary&mdash;afterwards Sir Charles Mills, agent
general in London&mdash;that a delightful party was organised for
the shooting of the &ldquo;Sicker Vlei,&rdquo; a vast expanse of
water in the vicinity of Wellington.</p>
<p>This magnificent lake is the resort of every kind of <a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>wild beast
and bird.&nbsp; Strings of flamingoes wade leisurely about it,
whilst wild geese and swans of enormous proportions float lazily
over one&rsquo;s head; antelopes and buck of every description
come down to water, and the Cape leopard&mdash;the most
treacherous and cowardly of four-footed creatures&mdash;is to be
met with in considerable numbers as day begins to break.&nbsp;
The procedure that obtains is similar to that in all ordinary
mountain loch shooting, with the solitary exception that it
necessitates a start about 3 a.m., so that every one is posted
amongst the rushes at two hundred yards&rsquo; intervals an hour
before daybreak.&nbsp; The excitement, the delight, the profound
silence of that hour when Nature seems to rouse itself for its
daily routine of activity, requires an abler pen than mine to
describe.</p>
<p>With a rifle in hand and a shot gun at one&rsquo;s side, there
is, however, nothing for it but to wait for daybreak, wondering
whether buck or antelope, cheetah or wild fowl will be the first
to come within range.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trekking&rdquo; with our span of oxen to a farmhouse,
where only two cots were available, it was our nightly custom to
play &ldquo;nap&rdquo; as to who should occupy the beds and who
the kitchen table and dresser, and the excitement ran just as
high as it did in the days when fifties and hundreds were at
stake in the card room of the old Raleigh.</p>
<p>But the losers did not lose much, for almost before one was
asleep it was time to be up for our usual 3 a.m. start.</p>
<p>With me was placed dear old Arthur Barkly, the worst shot and
most passionate of good fellows, last Governor of Heligoland, and
long since gone over to the majority, and it evokes a smile when
even now I think of how, having missed with both barrels two huge
wild geese that leisurely floated twenty yards over his head, he
threw a cartridge box and then a ramrod in his passion at the
unoffending birds.</p>
<p><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>But
the shot had scared other denizens of the plain, and bang, bang
in every direction indicated that all our guns were in action as
cheetahs and antelopes might be seen scuttling on all
sides.&nbsp; Nothing further being left for us, we proceeded to
count our bag and return to the farmstead.</p>
<p>After a few days devoted to &ldquo;braying&rdquo; the skins
and &ldquo;curing&rdquo; the antelope meat for future
consumption, we resumed our dreary bumping &ldquo;trek&rdquo;
into the interior in the hope of meeting with big game.</p>
<p>Lions are occasionally, but rarely, met with in these parts,
and it is with reference to a dramatic incident that might have
ended fatally that I will confine my present remarks.&nbsp;
Returning one evening to our location, with literally only three
ball cartridges amongst us, one of the Kaffir boys descried in
the distance a lion and lioness and three cubs.&nbsp; With bated
breath and excitement running high, a council of war was hastily
convened, and the pros and cons., the direction of the wind, and
the dearth of ammunition having been variously discussed, it was
decided that to attack them would be unwise, if not absolutely
foolhardy.&nbsp; A wounded lion or lioness with its cubs is
probably as dangerous as a man-eating tiger; yet, despite all our
entreaties to the contrary, one daring spirit determined to
attempt to stalk them.</p>
<p>Loading both barrels of his rifle with ball, with the other
solitary cartridge placed handily in his pocket, and divested of
all other impediments, he hastily retired to make a circuit and
so get within shot against the wind.</p>
<p>Suddenly we heard the sharp report of his rifle, and then,
after a second, we saw the lion make for the spot whence the
smoke had come, whilst the lioness and the cubs scampered off in
the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Again there was a report, and next we saw Fellowes running
with all his might, followed by the lion.</p>
<p><a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>What
ensued may best be given in his own words, as narrated to us that
night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had evidently missed my first shot, and whilst
putting in my other cartridge, I saw the brute making for me;
again I fired, and I saw it staggered him, but still he came on,
and seeing a small pond a few yards off I decided to make for
that.&nbsp; Barely had I risen to my feet when, with a roar, the
brute was close behind me, and at the very moment I dashed into
the pond he aimed a blow at me which grazed my forehead, and I
fell prostrate into it.&nbsp; On recovering I cautiously peeped,
and there the brute stood on the edge within three yards of
me.&nbsp; Again I submerged, but every time I moved for air he
roared, although afraid to enter the water.&nbsp; This went on
for an hour, when conceive my delight at seeing him roll over
from loss of blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cautiously approaching, I found he was stone
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fellowes had literally escaped death by a hair&rsquo;s
breadth; but the scar he carried with him to his grave affected
his brain, and he was never the same man again.&nbsp; Had the
lion been one inch nearer his skull would have been smashed like
an egg shell.&nbsp; Years after I saw the lion&rsquo;s head and
shoulders at a well-known naturalist&rsquo;s in Piccadilly,
depicted life-like dashing out of the rushes that encircled the
African pond.</p>
<p>Our excitement for big game being temporarily satiated after
our comrade&rsquo;s narrow escape, we decided to direct our steps
towards more peaceful pastures in the neighbourhood of
Stellenbosch.&nbsp; Here large ostrich farms exist, and it was a
unique experience to watch drafts of these huge birds being
transferred from one farm to another.&nbsp; The procedure is
original.&nbsp; Two or three mounted Kaffirs with long driving
whips circle round and round the twenty or thirty birds, lashing
them unmercifully on their bare legs till they <a
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>start into
a trot, which eventually ends in a pace that the riders at full
gallop have difficulty in keeping up with.&nbsp; In my search for
information I was assured that the feathers so much in demand for
&ldquo;matinee hats&rdquo; were moulted from the birds; but this
I found to be not strictly accurate, and much cruel
&ldquo;plucking&rdquo; passed under my own observation.&nbsp;
Ostrich egg omelette is delicious; six of us breakfasted off
<i>one</i> egg, and my sensations were as if I had swallowed an
omnibus.</p>
<p>But perhaps the most ridiculous experience to be obtained in
South Africa is associated with the (apparently) inoffensive
penguin.&nbsp; Any one looking at these sedate creatures at the
Zoological Gardens would hardly believe that they can bite and
take a piece out of one&rsquo;s calf with the dexterity of a
bull-terrier.&nbsp; It was shortly after the experience above
related that we turned our steps towards Penguin Island, which
lies to the south of Table Bay.&nbsp; We had been offered a
&ldquo;cast over&rdquo; in one of the fishing boats that proceed
there periodically in the interests of the lessee who, renting
this valuable island for a few pounds a year, makes an enormous
income by the sale of the guano.</p>
<p>We had landed cheerily, and were roaring at the absurd
attitudes taken up under every ledge and stone by these pompous
old birds, when poor Bobby, going a little too close, was seized
by the leg with the grip of a rat-trap.</p>
<p>When the guano parties visit the island they combine another
industry, and collect some thousands of eggs, which are
considered a delicacy by the Africander gourmets.</p>
<p>Personally, I found them too strong, although I plead guilty
to having massacred some fifty penguins by knocking them on the
head for the sake of their breasts.&nbsp; The oil that exhales
from them for months, despite the alum and sifted ashes, is
incredible; but <a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>they will repay the trouble, and after scientific
manipulation by a London furrier are highly appreciated for muffs
and boas.</p>
<p>The albatross that swarm in the vicinity of Table Bay, and
which are caught in large numbers by the Malay fishermen, enabled
me to create a new industry.&nbsp; Finding that the flesh only
was used by the Malays, I offered the handsome price of one penny
for every pair of pinion bones duly delivered at the barracks;
these I forthwith filed off at each end, and tying them into
bundles, stuffed them into ants&rsquo; nests.&nbsp; Within a week
they were as clear as whistles, and within a month I possessed a
fagot of some hundreds.&nbsp; The recital of an absurd sequel may
not be amiss.&nbsp; Albatross quills of twelve and fifteen inches
are a popular species of pipe stem, which, when encircled with a
threepenny silver band attached to a shilling amber mouthpiece,
may be seen in leading tobacconists&rsquo; labelled twenty
shillings.&nbsp; Entering a palatial establishment in Regent
Street on my return home, I got the proprietor into conversation,
and was assured that they were very difficult things to procure,
and that he would gladly &ldquo;pay anything&rdquo; if only he
could get some more.&nbsp; Having thoroughly compromised him, I
returned next day with a cab full, and although exceptionally
long and perfect, I was surprised to hear they were by no means
up to the mark, and in my desperation accepted a box of cigars in
exchange for what he probably cleared &pound;50 on.</p>
<p>Yet another experience&mdash;not strictly of a sporting
character&mdash;was connected with sticks.&nbsp; On my return
home I brought with me some hundreds of the rarest specimens from
Ceylon, Mauritius, and the Cape.&nbsp; Conceive my
disappointment, after an animated barter with Briggs, of St.
James&rsquo;s Street, to be grateful to accept any three of my
own sticks mounted to order in exchange for what must have
supplied half the <a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>golden calves of the West End with sticks varying from
two to three guineas a-piece.</p>
<p>The above two incidents exemplify what is described as the
encouragement of British industries.</p>
<p>At the risk of wearying the reader I will give an absurd
incident that once occurred in India.&nbsp; We had organised a
party to hunt up a tiger that had been seen near the village of
Dharwar, not far from Belgaum.&nbsp; On our way to the
rendezvous&mdash;where the serious search was to
commence&mdash;one of our party who had wandered a little out of
his course rushed frantically up to us, exclaiming: &ldquo;I came
suddenly within thirty yards of the brute fast asleep at the foot
of the nullah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; we all asked, &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t you
shoot him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Pon my word, I had half a mind to,&rdquo; was
the heartfelt reply&mdash;&ldquo;but, so help me bob, I funked
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Touching the fringe of these vast hunting grounds will, I
hope, be forgiven me, for although six thousand miles from
London, they nevertheless bring up very happy memories of the
long-ago sixties.</p>
<p>Sir John Bissett, afterwards commanding the Infantry Brigade
at Gibraltar, but at the time a resident at Grahamstown, was the
Great Nimrod of the Cape.</p>
<p>It was he that organised the elephant hunts for the Duke of
Edinburgh, at one of which the Prince shot the immense beast
whose head confronted one on entering Clarence House.&nbsp;
Although I did not actually see it shot, I was not far distant at
the time.</p>
<p>It was weeks after our party&rsquo;s return to Cape Town that
Colonel Zebulon Pike brought me two splendid stuffed specimens of
the boatswain bird, the rarest of the gull tribe.</p>
<p>As I admired their mauve and white plumage and the two long
scarlet feathers that constitute their tail, I could not resist
remarking: &ldquo;Why, Colonel, where did you get
these?&rdquo;&nbsp; To which he replied: <a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>&ldquo;I
shot them one morning after bathing, before you fellows were
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was not a boatswain bird within fifty miles of where we
had been, and the specimens had evidently been cured for
years.</p>
<p>It was only a righteous lie, such as the generous
&ldquo;Colonel&rdquo; could never resist.</p>
<h2><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>CHAPTER XX.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">EASTWARD HO!</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> no ingredients are more
certain to produce an explosion in a limited space than a Post
Captain proceeding as a passenger on the ship of an officer some
months his junior.&nbsp; It was my privilege once to watch one of
these preliminary simmerings during the latter sixties and the
subsequent inevitable d&eacute;nouement.</p>
<p>George Malcolm, who in his younger days had had a
distinguished career as flag-lieutenant at Portsmouth, but for a
decade had lived the indolent life of a German at Frankfort,
being compelled by the regulations to put in sea time as a Post
Captain, was proceeding with a new crew to recommission the
<i>Danae</i> on the West Indian station.&nbsp; It was not long
before he developed his Teutonic acquirements.&nbsp; Smoking half
the night in his cabin, he intimated to his crew that they might
smoke when they pleased.&nbsp; Keeping his lights burning after
hours, he next came into collision with the master-at-arms, who
reported the irregularity to the captain, a peremptory order
being issued that Malcolm was not to be made an exception, and
that the regulations were to be enforced.&nbsp; The little
man&mdash;Captain Grant, of the <i>Himalaya</i>&mdash;who thus
entered the lists at the first challenge was well-known
throughout the Navy as a veritable tartar.&nbsp; Standing little
over five feet high, <a name="page223"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 223</span>he had the body of a giant; his
lower proportions were short and far from comely.&nbsp; These
were the combatants for whom the arena was now cleared.&nbsp;
Malcolm opened the attack by repeating the light-burning after
hours.&nbsp; Grant retorted by ordering the master-at-arms to
enter if necessary and carry out his orders.&nbsp; Next morning
the two captains met in presence of their respective first
lieutenants, and abused and accused each other of insubordination
and mutiny.</p>
<p>The crews meanwhile took up the quarrel, and some of the
<i>Danae</i> men had the temerity to cheek the
master-at-arms.&nbsp; To this little Grant replied by tying up
six of them to the shrouds, and giving them four dozen apiece
with the cat.&nbsp; This checked the effervescence, and a few
days later the ship entered Port Royal.</p>
<p>Then followed reports.&nbsp; But the admiral was one of the
psalm-singing school, and not possessing sufficient character to
adjudicate upon it himself, referred the matter home.&nbsp;
Meanwhile the <i>Danae</i> was recommissioned and sailed away,
the <i>Himalaya</i> returned to Portsmouth, and so the matter
ended.</p>
<p>A flogging in the old days was a very &ldquo;thorough&rdquo;
affair, and lost nothing in the matter of detail.&nbsp; Four
stalwart boatswains stripped to their shirts stood like statues,
on the deck reposed four green baize bags, each containing a
cat.</p>
<p>When all was ready the captain&rsquo;s warrant was
read&mdash;for it may or may not be generally known that every
skipper, from battleship to pigboat, is a justice of the peace,
and has the power of life and death on the high seas&mdash;and
then the operation began.&nbsp; Occasionally some genius, having
prearranged to outwit the authorities, would feign collapse by
suddenly tucking up his legs; but a feel of the pulse and a nod
soon adjusted matters, and the culprit was in &ldquo;full
song.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then the little man made a speech, not too
long, but very much to the point: &ldquo;Now, my lads, <a
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>when you
want any more, you know where to come for it.&rdquo;&nbsp; After
which he cocked his cap, and descended to his cabin with his
sword clanking behind.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a way they had in the
Navy.</p>
<p>All this, of course, was before the central authority was
transferred from Whitehall to Whitechapel, and without expressing
an opinion on the merits or demerits of corporal punishment, one
may be permitted to ask: Are the bluejackets of to-day any better
than Peel&rsquo;s Naval Brigade in the Crimea, or the tough old
tars that helped to quell the Mutiny?&nbsp; Are the specimens one
occasionally meets smoking cigarettes and Orange Blossom tobacco
superior to the old sea dogs that chewed what would have killed a
rhinoceros and rolled quids of &rsquo;baccy saturated in
rum?&nbsp; Perhaps yes, perhaps no.&nbsp; Be that as it may,
flogging has ever been found the only deterrent for a certain
class of scum which occasionally rises to the surface even in the
Navy.</p>
<p>On another occasion, when I was embarking at Portsmouth,
barely had the <i>Himalaya</i> left the side of the quay when the
Honourable Mrs. Montmorency (afterwards Lady Frankfort),
accompanied by her father, Sir John Michel, and a crowd of
sisters, cousins, and aunts, might have been seen rushing
frantically towards the slowly-moving trooper; but the cries fell
on deaf ears, and the good ship continued her course.</p>
<p>Next night in Queenstown Harbour a bumboat might have been
seen struggling against wind and tide to reach the trooper lying
a mile out at sea, which, on getting alongside, was found to
contain the lady, who, since we last saw her, had undertaken a
journey of four hundred miles, attended by every discomfort that
travelling flesh is heir to, and all because she did not know
little Grant, and expected to impress him by arriving five
minutes late.&nbsp; The same lady very nearly had a similar
experience a <a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>month later at St. Helena, and only just reached the
deck as the &ldquo;blue Peter&rdquo; was being hauled down.</p>
<p>It was on this same voyage that a subaltern, whose duties
compelled him to be on deck at daylight, remarked to the
navigating-lieutenant later in the day: &ldquo;How splendid the
sun looked this morning rising over the hills.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh! yes,&rdquo; was the snubbing reply, &ldquo;we call
that Cape Flyaway.&nbsp; Why, man, we are five hundred miles from
the West coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night, when hammocks were being issued, a cry of
&ldquo;Land on the port bow&rdquo; brought all hands on deck, and
lo! we were steaming full speed for land with 1,400 souls on
board.&nbsp; Almost in front of us was an angry surf, a little
beyond it tropical foliage was distinctly visible, and then
followed the silence as when engines are stopped, and with extra
hands at both wheels, the shout of &ldquo;Hard
a-starboard!&rdquo; pierced the darkness, and we were going full
speed in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Cape Flyaway cost poor little Piper a reprimand and half-pay
for life, and an innocent wife and family&mdash;God help
them&mdash;may still be suffering for that disregarded
sunrise.</p>
<p>When dear old Admiral Commerell succeeded Purvis as
Commander-in-Chief at the Cape, things at Government House hummed
as they had never done before, and the energy that the little man
put into his hospitality was as conspicuous as when fighting on
sea or on land.&nbsp; With more than the lives attributed to a
cat, it is incredible that he should have survived a blunderbuss
full of slugs on the Prah a few years later, which, fired point
blank, drove half a monkey-jacket into his lungs.&nbsp; Though
brought to Cape Town on the <i>Rattlesnake</i>, more as a
formality than with any hopes of recovery, and for months after
spitting up pieces of blue serge, he rallied as he had often done
before, and the last time I saw him was in a Maxim gun show-room
in Victoria Street, where, <a name="page226"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 226</span>as &ldquo;Managing Director,&rdquo;
he explained the intricacies of the weapon to every &rsquo;Arry
that chose to look in, and so trade laid hands in his declining
years on as brave a recipient of the Victoria Cross as ever trod
a quarter-deck.</p>
<p>When the flying squadron under Beauchamp Seymour was expected
at Ascension on its return from the Cape, great excitement
prevailed from the possibility of a visit, and a trooper that was
&ldquo;laying off&rdquo; was in such deadly fear of any want of
smartness being observable that the washing by the
soldiers&rsquo; wives that had been permitted was made short work
of, and petticoats, shirts, and socks that were fluttering in the
breeze were ruthlessly ordered down, for fear some signalman
should detect a strange signal and note it in the log-book.&nbsp;
For this lynx-eyed race is incapable of being hoodwinked; indeed,
so dexterous did they become in the Channel Squadron some years
ago (and doubtless are so still) that they read the signals for
fleet man&oelig;uvres before the flags were broken, necessitating
the entire bunch being rolled into one, and so giving every ship
an equal chance of displaying their smartness.&nbsp; Of the
turtle we discussed recently, the &ldquo;last phase&rdquo; is to
be seen in the smoking-room of a well-known hostelry in
Leadenhall Street, where, peeping through the tanks, numerous
specimens may be seen blinking and winking as if in reproach at
the unfair advantage taken of them by perfidious Albion in
leading them into captivity when guests of the nation and in an
interesting condition.</p>
<p>Ascension, as most of us are aware, is on the direct road to
the Cape and within easy distance of St. Helena&mdash;a by no
means unpleasant place, despite an unjust prejudice that attaches
to it.</p>
<p>It was on board a Union steamer that the absurd incident I
witnessed took place, when the diamond fields were coming into
notice and attracting <a name="page227"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 227</span>speculators in every kind of ware
likely to find favour amongst the natives, who had not then been
educated in Houndsditch ways to the extent they have since
arrived at.&nbsp; The genius who contemplated a rich harvest not
discounted by any such absurd formalities as paying
&ldquo;duty,&rdquo; declaring contraband, or propitiating
officials apt to be too inquisitive, was a Hebrew jeweller of a
pronounced type with the unusual adornment of carroty hair, who
afterwards developed into a Bond Street shopkeeper, and may still
be seen shorn of his sunny locks, which nevertheless still retain
a pleasing suspicion of the blaze they once emitted.&nbsp; The
chief officer was a shrewd individual, who long before we arrived
at Table Bay had taken his passenger&rsquo;s measure, and what
added insult to injury was a presentation to him of a wretched
ring the wholesale price of which could not have exceeded ten
shillings.&nbsp; Had he pressed a five-pound note into his hand
it would have proved a less expensive procedure.&nbsp; The sequel
was disastrous, as, passing through the dock gates, &rsquo;Enery
was requested to turn out his pockets, and the percentage to the
informant amounted to a very handsome sum.&nbsp; Who the
informant was&mdash;actuated by duty!&mdash;it is needless to
discuss, but our friend got to the Fields at last and turned a
considerable profit on his &ldquo;Brummagem&rdquo; wares.</p>
<p>Years later his enterprise again brought him into notice by
providing a young ass (whom many will recollect), who had come
into &pound;70,000 on attaining his majority, not only with a
flat, but completely furnishing it, and then smothering him with
bracelets and bangles for personal wear, and trinkets and
gimcracks that made him rattle to a greater extent than the
historical lady of Banbury Cross.</p>
<p>The sequel was more melodramatic.&nbsp; Within a year the
entire &pound;70,000 was gone, within another year the prodigal
was in his grave, and, despite the strenuous <a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>efforts of
an elder brother to recover a trifle from the clutches of a
philanthropist, a feather merchant, and dramatic author&mdash;all
since gathered into Abraham&rsquo;s bosom&mdash;the shekels never
changed hands&mdash;s&rsquo;help me&mdash;and &rsquo;Enery is
still one of the most respected Elders in Israel.</p>
<p>It was in &rsquo;65 on the island of Ascension, where I
happened temporarily to be, that an awful tragedy was on the
verge of being investigated by a Court of Inquiry, but it was
realised that the terrible Atlantic rollers that perpetrated the
cruel deed and the innocent children that were the victims had
left no data for the groundwork of the conventional farce.</p>
<p>It was on that dismal rock whose only merits are its
strategical coaling position and its inexhaustible supply of
turtle that during the season when those insidious rollers of
unbroken water, without sound, without warning, suddenly spread
over the sandy beach, two or three children of an officer of
Marines were suddenly swept off their legs and carried by the
back-wash with the velocity of a millstream towards the coral
reefs a hundred yards out at sea, where death awaited them.</p>
<p>On the one side an expanse of sand that forthwith resumed its
placid, shining surface, on the other a ripple literally
bristling with fins of the most voracious species of shark known
to naturalists.</p>
<p>In a second it was all over, and the crimson pall that covered
the face of the blue Atlantic told all there was to tell of the
terrible catastrophe.</p>
<p>The few observation boxes containing niggers on the look-out
for turtle had seen nothing, heard nothing; the only eye-witness
was the helpless nursemaid, and only because there was nothing to
tell was the farce of a &ldquo;Court of Inquiry&rdquo;
abandoned.</p>
<p>The turtle industry is simplicity itself: so soon as one
advances sufficiently inland a couple of niggers rush out and
turn her over and lug her into the tank, <a
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>when her
laying days are over, for it is the female only that is captured
as she comes to deposit her eggs, and no human eye has ever seen
nor any alderman ever guzzled amid the green fat of the male
animal.</p>
<p>Ascension is best described as the most God-forsaken spot in
creation, except perhaps Aden, to which must be given the
palm.&nbsp; Here the naval garrison seem to have grown into a
mechanical routine, and only change their monotonous wading
through sand by an occasional day&rsquo;s leave to Green
Mountain, on whose summit the only three blades of grass on the
island struggle for existence.&nbsp; How these gallant men are
chosen for this dreary duty it is difficult to say; no alien
princeling attached to the British Navy ever appears to have his
turn; and one must assume that &ldquo;merit tempered with
non-interest&rdquo; is the qualification that controls the
roster.&nbsp; Of the turtle there can be no two opinions; in
unlimited supplies, two huge tanks, through which the tide ebbs
and flows, contain some hundreds of these delectable creatures,
delectable only with the aid of the highest embellishments, but
the most nauseous sickening of &ldquo;<i>plats</i>&rdquo; in the
shape of rations.&nbsp; Every man-of-war calling at Ascension is
compelled to ship a dozen, which lie for weeks on deck, their
heads resting on a swab, and the hose playing on them of a
morning, while a stench more insidious than the vapours of a
fried-fish shop attaches itself to everything; one&rsquo;s
hair-brush reeks like a turtle fin, and whether one eats, drinks,
or smokes, it&rsquo;s <i>toujours tortue</i>.</p>
<p>During the Ashanti war, Ascension appeared at its best; in its
comfortable hospital the wounded from spear and slug, and the
dying from West Coast fever, obtained the best of
attendance.&nbsp; In it I saw Thompson, of the Inniskilling
Dragoons, just brought down from the Prah&mdash;one of the most
popular men in the <a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span>Army&mdash;die; whilst from it many a brave man has
been carried to his last home, and many a sufferer who has
entered its portals in apparently the last stage of fever and
ague has been pulled round, and put on board with renewed life to
return to England to bless the surgeons and curse Ascension.</p>
<p>It was on my return home in &rsquo;69 that I met old Toogood
(whom everybody knew) at Aden&mdash;who, rushing up to me,
whispered, &ldquo;Come along, I&rsquo;ve secured a
carriage,&rdquo; and following with that glee that all who have
crossed the Desert will appreciate, I was horrified to find he
had all his bundles in the quarantine carriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great heavens,&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;do you know
what this means?&rdquo; and he hardly gave me time to explain the
pains and penalties before he was in full cry after the rascally
Egyptian guard, who, realising he was dealing with a novice, had
accepted a sovereign for placing him in a carriage by
himself.</p>
<p>In those long-ago days&mdash;and possibly still&mdash;every
train had a quarantine carriage, entering which meant vigorous
isolation till fumigation had taken place, and &ldquo;even
betting&rdquo; that one&rsquo;s cabin in the trooper at Cairo
would have remained vacant homeward bound.</p>
<p>When the Japanese were airing their aspirations at becoming
the great naval power they now are, I witnessed one of their
virgin attempts at navigating a warship under the control of
British officers.&nbsp; Confident of their ability, and fretting
to show what they could do, they one day insisted on landing
their instructors and assuming temporary control of the
ship.&nbsp; The development was not long in coming.&nbsp; Away
flew the ship, in graceful circles round and round the bay, when
suddenly a dashing man&oelig;uvre beyond the comprehension of the
most enlightened observer, and, lo! she was steaming full speed
for the shore.&nbsp; Within the hour she was well wedged on <a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>a sandy
bottom, and a tidal wave not long after having considerately
lifted her a few hundred yards higher up, the hull was converted
into an hotel, and for years gave ocular proof of Japan&rsquo;s
first triumph in navigation.&nbsp; That was in the later sixties,
when Togo was still in the womb of futurity.</p>
<p>In those long-ago days, Yokohama had not attained its present
respectable civilisation; top hats were sought after as the
daintiest of fashionable attainments; every battered specimen on
board fetched its weight in gold; open baths for mixed bathing
were to be met with in the public thoroughfares; British
regimental guards disarmed fanatics before allowing them to enter
the town; inlaid bronzes, miniature trees, and genuine curios
were procurable; massive Birmingham products had not become an
industry wherewith to catch the unwary; public crucifixions by
transfixing with bamboo stakes (such as I witnessed in the case
of the murder of a British officer) were still in full blast, and
the sweetest little girls were to be bought for domestic service,
and sent to be dealt with by the nearest magistrate on the breath
of a suspicion of breach of fidelity.&nbsp; To go a mile beyond
the Treaty Port was to court certain death, whilst to remain
peacefully within the town and visit the various day and night
entertainments was as delightful an existence as the most
blas&eacute; reprobate could desire.</p>

232</span>CHAPTER XXI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE GUILLOTINE AND MADAME
RACHEL.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> one of my numerous visits to
Paris a notorious poisoner&mdash;Le-Pommerais&mdash;was awaiting
execution by the guillotine.</p>
<p>I am not of a cruel disposition, but I confess that certain
sights afford me a morbid gratification, the more so as I know
that one witness more or less can in no way affect the victim,
who, in nine cases out of ten, is dazed, despite the bravado that
is sometimes assumed.</p>
<p>I had seen M&uuml;ller and the pirates hanged in London, and a
man &ldquo;garrotted&rdquo; at Barcelona; I had seen two soldiers
shot at Bregenz on the Lake Constance, and now for the first time
in my life I was within measurable distance of the Place de la
Gr&egrave;ve, where the most hideous drama, accompanied by all
the pomp that a dramatic nation can introduce, was to be enacted
one morning.&nbsp; But what morning?&nbsp; There was the rub, for
the French are nothing if not original, and whilst permitting the
unhappy victim to drink and smoke and play cards till 2 a.m.
ruthlessly rouse him a couple of hours later, and roughly proceed
to prepare his toilette.</p>
<p>Inquire as I did, nobody could give me the day, and although
on more than one occasion I had driven to the accursed spot and
waylaid officials likely to know, their replies were invariably
the same; nobody knew, nobody cared, it would be time enough when
<a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>the
fateful morning arrived, and then <i>voil&agrave;</i>; a rush of
two powerful men on a defenceless, trussed fellow-creature; a
shove with unnecessary violence on to a plank, a strap or two
unnecessarily tight to secure the unresisting wretch; a jerk and
a flash of burnished steel; a quivering trunk, and a head
squirting blood yards high, and the handful of sawdust, and the
roar of a delighted multitude as &ldquo;Monsieur de Paris&rdquo;
leisurely proceeds to light a cigarette, and within five minutes
the whole ghastly paraphernalia has disappeared within the gloomy
parallelograms of La Roquette.</p>
<p>Terrible as all this sounds, is it not less terrible than the
secret executions indulged in by our own merciful laws?&nbsp;
There at least excitement must for the time hold the victim till
the supreme moment arrives, whilst here the granite walls, the
grim officials, the parson mumbling prayers, divest the function
of everything but strict officialism, which to the culprit must
indeed be the very bitterness of death.</p>
<p>When the name of Count La Grange was more familiar to English
ears than it is in these forty years later days, it was my
delightful privilege to know&mdash;if not the redoubtable Count
himself&mdash;a fair and important member of the distinguished
sportsman&rsquo;s family circle.&nbsp; I had, indeed, seen
&ldquo;Waterloo avenged&rdquo; at Epsom in the June of 1864, when
Gladiateur left the field miles behind; but it was only in the
following autumn that I made the personal acquaintance of the
goddess who professed a kind of allegiance to the sporting
Frenchman, and re-avenged, as it were, the vengeance that had
been meted out to my country the previous summer.</p>
<p>I was in Paris under the wing of Bob Hope-Johnstone, the
terrible major, whose dislike was a thing to be avoided, and
whose blow, as a certain bric-&agrave;-brac pair of Israelite
brothers once discovered to their cost, was like the kick of a
horse.&nbsp; We had dipped <a name="page234"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 234</span>pretty freely into the delights of
that most delightful of cities, when, sipping our coffee one
evening on the terrace of the Caf&eacute; de la Paix, we were
transfixed&mdash;at least, I was&mdash;by what appeared a
heavenly being stepping out of a brougham.&nbsp; In those
benighted days a brisk trade was done in the &ldquo;Cabinets
particulier&rdquo; that extended over the upper floors of the
historical caf&eacute;, and night after night the best men and
the loveliest women of the Third Empire resorted thither by
battalions and indulged in every delight that the best of cookery
and the best of wines never failed to stimulate.</p>
<p>An obliging <i>ma&icirc;tre d&rsquo;h&ocirc;tel</i> had
informed me who the lady was, and possessing a reserve of
assurance, since happily simmered down into a reserved and
retiring disposition, I sent up my name without further ado and
craved permission to pay my homage.&nbsp; It would be absurd and
nauseous to repeat the beautiful phrases one poured into the ear
of a being who, if alive now&mdash;which is doubtful&mdash;has
probably not a tooth in her head; suffice to say she was a superb
&eacute;cart&eacute; player, and initiated me into the rudiments
of the game.&nbsp; It seemed marvellous to me that such a goddess
should strive so laboriously to overcome in me the violation of
every canon of the game, but in those long-ago days I was fair of
hair and of a ruddy countenance, and the coincidence may not have
been so extraordinary after all.&nbsp; Often of an afternoon I
visited her hotel in the Bois de Boulogne, and it was only when
La Grange was known to be in Paris that my going in and coming
out was in the least circumscribed.</p>
<p>Sitting at a table, with his blubber lips lingering over a
glass of absinthe, was our old acquaintance,
&ldquo;Jellybelly,&rdquo; who, noticing the late Duke of Hamilton
and Claud de Crespigny within hail, bellowed out, &ldquo;Will
your Grace tell me the French for crab, I feel itching for one at
dinner?&rdquo; and on being told a <a name="page235"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 235</span>species&mdash;not of the
sea&mdash;shouted in his purest Franco-Houndsditch,
&ldquo;<i>Garsong</i>, <i>apporty moir un morphion
r&ocirc;ti</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the police have lately been somewhat in evidence over the
commission as to whether they are as corrupt as some people
consider them, an instance of over-zeal that occurred long ago
will, I trust, be laid to heart in future criticisms.</p>
<p>Lord Chief Justice Cockburn and his boon companion, Serjeant
Ballantine, once witnessed an act of unnecessary brutality
towards a female in the Haymarket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why this unnecessary violence, my man?&rdquo; inquired
the amiable Sir Alexander.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind your own business, or I&rsquo;ll show you,&rdquo;
was the reply of the zealous constable, and within a trice the
female was forgotten and her two champions found themselves in
Vine Street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name,&rdquo; inquired a priggish inspector of the Lord
Chief Justice, and on being informed, he added: &ldquo;No
doubt&mdash;we&rsquo;ve heard this kind of thing
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yours,&rdquo; he continued, addressing the great
serjeant.&nbsp; &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; he added, on being told,
and nothing but the entry of an official who recognised them
prevented the two great legal luminaries from spending a night in
the cells.</p>
<p>As every one is aware, neither of these distinguished men were
saints, but they respected the ordinary laws of humanity, and did
not admit that every poor wretch who had stooped to folly was the
legitimate target for kicks and cuffs and lying testimony.</p>
<p>Although a leap into the seventies is necessary, the sensation
that the so-called &ldquo;Great Turf Fraud&rdquo; caused must
excuse a brief reference to it.&nbsp; It was in 1877 that an old
lady with ample means conceived the brilliant idea of adding to
her income by speculating on the Turf.&nbsp; Her choice of
colleagues, however, was not a happy one, and before long she was
<a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>led
blindly by a genius known to posterity as Benson.&nbsp; Amongst
his staff was a brilliant phalanx, the two brothers Carr, Murray,
Bates, and the inevitable solicitor, one Froggatt.</p>
<p>A house in Northumberland Street, since pulled down, was where
these worthies matured their plans, and by the irony of fate, in
the very next house lived Superintendent Thompson, of Bow Street,
who, astute as he was reputed to be, was oblivious of the
cauldron that was simmering for months under his very nose.</p>
<p>It was in the suitable month of April&mdash;possibly the
first&mdash;that the old lady (Madame Goncourt) opened the ball
by paying out in driblets &pound;13,000.&nbsp; When the sum rose
to &pound;40,000 she became sceptical, and took her first
sensible step and consulted a lawyer.</p>
<p>At this point the police came on the scene, and again the
genius of Benson appears, for he, grasping the situation, bought
up certain Scotland Yard inspectors who, for a
consideration&mdash;and a large one&mdash;undertook to warn the
chief culprits how and when danger was to be avoided.</p>
<p>Consultations in Northumberland Street were now deemed risky,
so the venue was changed to the &ldquo;Rainbow Tavern&rdquo; (now
known as the &ldquo;Argyll&rdquo;), a pot-house abutting on
Oxford Street, and there the original conspirators and their
solicitor, augmented by Inspectors Druscovitch, Meiklejohn, and
Palmer, arranged for telegrams and other details to defeat the
ends of justice.</p>
<p>The commonplace sequel will suggest itself to most
people.&nbsp; Benson, the two Carrs, Bates, and Froggatt were
sent to penal servitude for fifteen and ten years
respectively.&nbsp; Later on Benson &ldquo;peached&rdquo; on his
police allies, who in November were tried, Druscovitch and
Meiklejohn receiving two years each, and Palmer being
acquitted.</p>
<p><a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>Madame Goncourt, it may be added, was still without her
profits.</p>
<p>After his fifteen years, Benson was currently supposed to have
burst out as the director of numerous shops in the metropolis,
where electric appliances for the instant cure of gout and
inhalers warranted to contain &ldquo;compressed Italian
air&rdquo; and to make everybody a Patti or a Mario were to be
had for a guinea; whilst a further guinea entitled the purchaser
to a consultation with the specialist.</p>
<p>This, however, did not last long, and Benson ended his career
shortly after by throwing himself over the balustrade of an
American gaol.</p>
<p>Surely never was a commonplace affair dignified with such a
high-sounding title!&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas the novelty that did
it.</p>
<p>Where one voracious old woman existed in the seventies, the
twentieth century could produce a dozen, and where two policemen
were caught accepting blackmail, a battalion exists to-day, only
their tactics have marched with the times, and instead of
receiving their levies in pot-houses, they secrete themselves in
cupboards and receive &ldquo;hush money&rdquo; from alien
brothel-keepers.&nbsp; At the same time, they affect the sorry
appearance associated with badly cut frock-coats and brimless
tall hats.&nbsp; The boots, however, beat them.</p>
<p>Very few of the <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i> appear to be
left.</p>
<p>Druscovitch for some years was employed as a Strand hotel
detective.&nbsp; Meiklejohn may occasionally be seen, unkempt and
down-at-heel, in the vicinity of mediocre saloon bars (glasses
only), and Madame Goncourt has long since explained to the
Recording Angel that though she was the first, she certainly
won&rsquo;t be the last, who has missed the certainties that go
begging on the Turf.</p>
<p>But the sixties were celebrated for a much more <a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>amusing and
widespread example of human credulity and vanity than the humdrum
so-called &ldquo;Turf frauds,&rdquo; with their unsavoury,
commonplace ingredients of a voracious old woman, a bevy of
sharpers, and a file of flat-footed police-inspectors.</p>
<p>It was in 1868 that London heard that a divine being was
amongst them, coming no one knew whence, and whose age no one
could guess, gifted with the power of arresting Time, restoring
youth and beauty, and ready&mdash;for a consideration&mdash;to
impart these blessings to all who sought her aid.</p>
<p>It was in the narrowest part of Bond Street that the goddess
pitched her tent, and to say that the traffic was impeded would
convey but a poor idea of the congestion that retarded locomotion
in that worst-built of thoroughfares.&nbsp; Old men desirous of
enamelling their bald old pates, ponderous females with scratch
wigs and asthma, and girls, pretty and ugly, with defects capable
of improvement, hustled and tussled to pay the fee of the
wonderful enchantress who guaranteed to restore youth to old age
and make one and all &ldquo;beautiful for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame Rachel was a bony and forbidding looking female, with
the voice of a Deal boatman and the physique of a
grenadier.&nbsp; The robes she affected when receiving her
clients, and the crystals and gimcracks that clattered at her
girdle, might well inspire awe, as, emerging from behind massive
curtains, she approached her victim with some phrase suggestive
of &ldquo;knowing all about it,&rdquo; which, indeed, was part of
the system when time and opportunity permitted, or the status of
the client justified it.</p>
<p>Rachel rarely smiled; when she laughed&mdash;which was rarer
still&mdash;it was the laugh of a rhinoceros.&nbsp; Assisting her
was a beautiful girl, of the <i>beaut&eacute; du diable</i> type,
with the suspicion of a cast in one of her heavy-lashed eyes,
which made her more bewitching than ever.</p>
<p><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>&ldquo;How old do you think my daughter?&rdquo; once
inquired the arch-impostor of a man from whom I had it
direct.&nbsp; He having replied &ldquo;Seventeen,&rdquo; she
turned to the siren with, &ldquo;Tell this gentleman, my child,
what you saw during the French Revolution, and how I took you to
see the execution of Marie Antoinette.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then &ldquo;Alma,&rdquo; coached to perfection, turned her
bewitching eyes as if peering into eternity, and began a string
of twaddle that ought not to have deceived a Bluecoat boy.</p>
<p>Everybody consulted Madame Rachel.&nbsp; If a youth got a
black eye at young Reed&rsquo;s sparring rooms (at the
&ldquo;Rising Sun&rdquo; in Whitehall) it was in Bond Street he
was made presentable for any fashionable function in the evening,
and in every conceivable walk of life one met evidence of the
universal sway of enamel; whilst nightly at the Opera, Rachel and
her daughter occupied a box on the grand tier and surveyed the
battalions of old men and old women, youths and maidens, who had
passed through their hands.</p>
<p>But despite Alma&rsquo;s charms, she had a narrow squeak of
being implicated with her mother in the prosecution that followed
later on&mdash;instead, however, she was taken in hand by Lady
Cardigan, and made a success in Grand Opera.&nbsp; But her
troubles were not yet over, and aspirants to her heart and hand
(enamelled and otherwise) were in considerable evidence nightly
at the Opera house in Paris.</p>
<p>It was at the hands of one of these she met her fate.&nbsp;
Carried away by jealousy or scorn, he shot her from the stalls,
though, happily, not fatally.&nbsp; After this she disappeared,
but not before displaying a magnanimity that was refreshing in
the reputed daughter of the flint-hearted Rachel, for she refused
to prosecute her assailant, who escaped with a nominal
imprisonment.</p>
<p><a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>A
controversy afterwards ensued in the daily Press as to the
becoming height of female dress; some advocated up to the
shoulder, others below, some a tape, some nothing; but the
important question has not yet been set at rest, and never will
be, despite County Council edicts in the name of propriety, or
the hypocrisy and flunkeydom that stalk over the land.</p>
<p>Alma in all her glory had her own ideas, and appeared
invariably and literally in &ldquo;semi-nude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Years after she was recognised by a former adorer at the
Concordia Music Hall in Constantinople, but all the
<i>beaut&eacute; du diable</i> had vanished; the cast still
remained, but failed to ravish&mdash;Nature had worked through
the enamel with which her skin had been saturated, and Alma pure
and simple remained&mdash;a living example of how &ldquo;Time
turns the old days to derision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame Rachel&rsquo;s experiences were of a more prosy
description, and, prosecuted a few years later by a Mrs.
Pearce&mdash;said to have been a daughter of
Mario&rsquo;s&mdash;whose jewels she had annexed in addition to a
considerable sum, she was relegated to five years&rsquo; penal
servitude.</p>
<p>But the most amusing incident has yet to be told, although it
seems incredible that even so foolish a woman should court
publicity by joining in the prosecution.&nbsp; The report of the
trial in any old paper of the period will convince the most
sceptical of the absence of exaggeration in this ungarnished
recital.</p>
<p>Mrs. Borrodale was a frivolous old lady of some forty years,
whose wealth, vanity, and frequent visits to Bond Street marked
her out as a desirable client to the astute Rachel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve won the heart of a great lord,&rdquo; was
her greeting one day, &ldquo;who desires to see you in your
natural beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>Mrs.
Borrodale, having first blushed through her enamel, was not long
in consenting, and having stipulated for a subdued light, and
that the &ldquo;view&rdquo; should be through a curtain,
proceeded to be enamelled from head to foot.&nbsp; On a given day
she posed in all the beauty of her birthday suit, and Lord
Ranelagh, who was the reputed admirer, peeped through a slit in
the tapestry&mdash;and, let us hope, then fled.</p>
<p>His lordship, it may be added, eventually died a
bachelor.&nbsp; The very title is extinct, and the enamelled old
Venus never assumed a coronet.&nbsp; After this, the old sinner
was known as &ldquo;Peeping Tom,&rdquo; and the foal by a
thoroughbred stallion of repute, Peeping Tom (which, however,
never attained any position on the Turf), was christened
Ranelagh.</p>
<p>Incredible as it may appear, this silly old woman capped her
indiscretion by joining in the prosecution instituted by the
stockbroker&rsquo;s wife, and so published to a gaping world what
might have better been left to the imagination.</p>
<p>Rachel has, it is currently reported, two sons at the present
moment practising as solicitors under high-sounding names, who
not long ago wriggled out of a nasty case by the skin of their
teeth, whilst their less acute Christian colleagues suffered the
penalty attendant on blackmailing.</p>
<p>But the Rachel establishment was by no means the only type
that flourished in the long-ago sixties by pandering to human
frailty, and the premises occupied by Madame Osch, situated at
the corner of Piccadilly and St. James&rsquo;s Street&mdash;and
now, like Babylon, with not one stone standing upon
another&mdash;could have told some curious tales of wards in
Chancery and Hebrew jewellers, and of Tommy and John, and of how
Tommy was arrested as he started for Monte Carlo, and how John,
smelling a rat, evaded ill effects; but the recitation would only
bore a twentieth-century reader, for human <a
name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>nature then
is the same nature as now, and what flourished then in one shape
still flourishes in another, and the only reflection worthy of
consideration is that, if these things were done in the green
tree, what is being done in the dry?</p>

<span class="GutSmall">REMINISCENCES OF THE PURPLE.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> death of the Duke of Cambridge
recalled many instances of the kindly nature of the old
warrior.&nbsp; Abused and ridiculed by the ignorant and unwashed
for actions&mdash;more or less imaginary&mdash;that he was
supposed to have been guilty of in the Crimea, it is established
on the testimony of eye-witnesses that no man showed more
personal bravery at Inkerman than the late illustrious
Duke.&nbsp; Oblivious to danger, and literally wandering in and
out amongst the dense masses of Russians, he seemed to bear a
charmed life, and if on any occasion he selected an
umbrella&mdash;which is by no means admitted&mdash;what greater
proof of absolute indifference to danger?&nbsp; As well might one
accuse Fred Burnaby of cowardice for confronting the Dervishes in
the Soudan with a simple blackthorn.&nbsp; But royalty has its
penalties as well as its advantages, and if the grandson of
George III. was subject to intense excitement verging on delirium
under exceptionally trying circumstances, let us be fair,
gentlemen, and give the bluff old warrior his dues.</p>
<p>In the zenith of his career, so unable was his Highness to
refuse almost any personal request, that it was found necessary
to chain a bulldog of the most pronounced Peninsular type on the
very threshold of the Commander-in-Chief&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>For this service General MacDonald was selected <a
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>as military
secretary, and any one who had the capacity of passing his meshes
was enabled to present himself at his Royal Highness&rsquo;s next
lev&eacute;e.</p>
<p>These functions were divested of all formality; an extension
of leave, a request to go to the dep&ocirc;t, an application to
join the service companies, was invariably more successful if
preferred personally, and &ldquo;Well, sir, what is it?&rdquo;
with a kindly shake of the hand saved many a heart-burning and
protracted filtration through a dozen departments, usually ending
in a snub.</p>
<p>Seated in the room was his aide-de-camp&mdash;the solitary
specimen in uniform.&nbsp; Colonel Fraser, V.C., had commanded
for years the celebrated &ldquo;Cherry-bobs&rdquo; (11th
Hussars), and if a little unsociable whilst in actual command,
the mannerism had entirely disappeared in the courteous
mouthpiece of the Duke.</p>
<p>Gazing one afternoon on the placid features of the
&ldquo;Royal George&rdquo; before the new War Office, the
occasion on which he once visited a station not 100 miles from
London and told the colonel and officers generally that he
didn&rsquo;t believe a word they said, and stamped and fumed and
swore and threatened, came vividly to my mind.&nbsp; There had
been a fracas in the canteen during the officers&rsquo; mess
hour, which eventually developed into a riot, and then was
quelled.&nbsp; No one in the mess-house appears to have heard it,
and it was only next morning that the matter, after
investigation, was reported to the Horse Guards.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Royal George,&rdquo; who was distinctly apoplectic, ran
many such chances of combustion in his younger days, for the old
warrior was by no means mealy-mouthed and was not above playing
to the gallery, as represented by the Press, and although he
could never aspire to rank with General Pennefather, he could,
when circumstances demanded, swear like any trooper.</p>
<p>It was the 11th that Lord Cardigan brought to <a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>such a
wonderful state of perfection and for the command of which he had
paid upwards of &pound;20,000 over regulation.&nbsp; It was in
the 11th that the fire-eating Colonel shot a captain of his
regiment dead in a duel, and only saved his commission by his
overwhelming interest.&nbsp; It was a regiment in which every
private was dressed and redressed at his Captain&rsquo;s expense
as if his uniform had been made by Poole, and where the overalls
and sleeves were so tight that one marvelled how officers or men
ever got in or out of them.</p>
<p>What a beautiful regiment it was in the old sixties.&nbsp; And
one felt it was a national crime to send such troops to
India.&nbsp; But all that, alas! is long since changed; the
Pimlico Clothing Works, economy, and paternal letters to <i>The
Times</i> have done the rest; and the abolition of purchase, the
breech-loader, and the new type of British officer have completed
the inauguration of the &ldquo;slops&rdquo; period, and abolished
once and for ever well-dressed regiments and <i>esprit de
corps</i>.</p>
<p>Whilst on this delicate subject memory suggests many
presumptuous reminiscences.</p>
<p>When Prince Alfred was a supernumerary Lieutenant of the
<i>Racoon</i>, what an ideal brick he was!&nbsp; Scraping on a
fiddle, myself at the piano, and Arthur Hood (lately become
Viscount Bridport) with a brass instrument of deafening
intensity, what harmonious discord has not shaken the rafters of
the old Casemates at Gibraltar; and when the Prince seated
himself at the piano and sang &ldquo;In ancient days there lived
a squire,&rdquo; one forgets the retiring potentate that
eventually ruled over Gotha.</p>
<p>It was on one of these occasions that during a lull in the
festivities a steady tramp outside was wafted to our musical
ears, and going out to discover the cause, I was horrified to see
an elderly gentleman, ablaze with decorations, in evening attire,
who, with numerous apologies, was conducted into the room.</p>
<p><a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>He
was in fact the Duc d&rsquo;Alen&ccedil;on&rsquo;s equerry, who
had honoured the private concert with his presence, and for the
past hour had sat a transfixed witness of our marvellous
harmony.&nbsp; At this time the <i>Racoon</i> was commanded by
Count Gleichen&mdash;a nephew of the late Queen&rsquo;s&mdash;who
once happened to be on the P. and O. at the same time as myself,
both returning from leave to Gibraltar.</p>
<p>In those days life on a P. and O. was a mass of enjoyment:
youngsters joining their regiments, old officers&mdash;naval and
military&mdash;returning from leave, the ship&rsquo;s officers,
all joined nightly in harmless jokes, and as lights were put out
and the steward&rsquo;s room closed, each roysterer ascended to
the upper deck and songs and what-not ensued.&nbsp; No one
entered into the revelry more than Count Gleichen, as, with a
tumbler of contraband grog, he quaffed and laughed as only a
British sailor can.</p>
<p>Years later, when the Duke of Edinburgh commanded the
<i>Galatea</i>, he still remembered his musical colleague, and a
pretty snake ring with a turquoise in the head that he presented
to me was lost in an accident that nearly cost me my life.</p>
<p>Boating has never been my forte, and in endeavouring on one
occasion to enter a boat, it drifted with the impact, and, with
one leg on the jetty and another in the boat, I soused into six
feet of the muddiest &ldquo;old Mole&rdquo; water.&nbsp;
Eventually I was hooked out, more &ldquo;mud than alive,&rdquo;
but the ring was gone, and still reposes in the turgid waters of
the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Amongst the ship&rsquo;s officers was Lord Charles Beresford,
at the time the most inveterate Fourth Lieutenant of practical
jokers.&nbsp; After a function at which the Duke and the
ship&rsquo;s company were on one occasion present, the local
Inspector-General of Police, who had deemed his presence
necessary, was staggered next morning by shouts of laughter as he
peacefully slumbered in his bungalow.</p>
<p><a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span>Rushing to the window, conceive his horror on seeing
Charlie Beresford, in his full uniform, strutting about and
giving words of command in imitation of the original.&nbsp; But
he was a bumptious buckeen, and no one sympathised with his
discomfiture.</p>
<p>When the King was doing his goose-step at the Curragh, it was
my high reflexed privilege to be doing mine in the next
lines.</p>
<p>It was during this season that a march for the whole division
was ordered to Maryborough, twenty-two miles distant.</p>
<p>The Prince, who was attached to the Grenadiers, accompanied us
to and fro, and even after the fatiguing march might later on
have been seen in the streets of Maryborough, accompanied by
&ldquo;his governor,&rdquo; General Bruce, as if nothing unusual
had occurred.&nbsp; It was lamentable the effect it had on those
splendid types of humanity, the 1st Grenadiers, and their superb
&ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s Company,&rdquo; every man six feet and
upwards.&nbsp; But the misfortune can hardly be laid to their
charge; suddenly transferred from their sweet pastures in London,
what wonder that the good things they had revelled in should seek
an outlet on the dusty plains of Kildare!&nbsp; And so it came to
pass that every ditch contained a guardsman, and long before the
twenty-two miles had been covered every ambulance in the division
was filled by the warriors.</p>
<p>The Vansittart family in those long-ago days were represented
by some interesting scions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Croc,&rdquo; in many ways perhaps the most unique,
was a remnant of a past generation who adapted surroundings to
modern requirements, and was the terror of gouty old members who
dined before four when &ldquo;table money&rdquo; came into force,
consumed a loaf in a sixpenny bowl of soup, and drank their beer
for nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pop,&rdquo; on the other hand, was of the <a
name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
248</span>highly-refined class, had a flat in Paris, and only
occasionally flashed upon London immaculately clothed in
ultra-fashionable attire.&nbsp; But the gem of the family was the
dear old Admiral, who combined apparently the better points of
&ldquo;The Croc&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pop&rdquo; in his own
weather-beaten person.&nbsp; At the time I knew him he was in
command of the <i>Sultan</i>, and had the reputation&mdash;in
conjunction with Admiral Hornby&mdash;of being the highest
authority on ironclads.&nbsp; But what brought him into notice
was a combination of fearless seamanship and bluff loyalty whilst
in command of the <i>Hector</i> that convoyed the Prince of Wales
from Canada.&nbsp; For days the weather had been rough till,
coming up Channel, Vansittart hailed a fishing smack, and
possessing himself of the pick of the last haul, bore down upon
the <i>Serapis</i>.&nbsp; Attached to her yard-arm was a basket,
and as the spars of the two frigates literally rattled against
one another, down dropped the offering at the feet of the
heir-apparent.</p>
<p>No greater exhibition of nerve and seamanship can well be
conceived; had the manoeuvre resulted in accident no explanation
would have satisfied &ldquo;my lords,&rdquo; for a nasty sea was
running and sea room was advisable, however commendable the
motive.&nbsp; It was an action worthy of association with Sir
Harry Keppel sailing out of Portsmouth Harbour in sheer devilry
with every stitch of canvas set, and showed Admiral Vansittart as
in every way worthy of being bracketed with that grand old
bluejacket of the past.</p>
<p>The man who commanded the <i>Galatea</i> and afterwards the
<i>Sultan</i>, was a very different person to the lieutenant of
the <i>Racoon</i>, and genial and adventurous as he once was, the
captain soon developed into a morose and unpopular commander.</p>
<p>On board the <i>Galatea</i> was the pick of the Navy, whilst
the social addenda associated with the supposed requirements of
Royalty were represented by the <a name="page249"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 249</span>present Lord Kilmorey, Eliot Yorke,
Arthur Haig, and sprigs of nobility, &ldquo;interest,&rdquo; and
nonentity.&nbsp; Of the two equerries Eliot Yorke&rsquo;s forte
may best be described as of the delicate type; so delicate,
indeed, that it may be left to the imagination.&nbsp; Arthur
Haig, on the other hand, was of the firm and reliable
sort&mdash;a reasonable proportion of &ldquo;suaviter&rdquo; with
a superabundance of the other thing.&nbsp; It was he whose daily
duties included an epitome of the events of the day, intended for
no eyes but those of the Queen, and carefully included in every
&ldquo;bag&rdquo; that left the ship.&nbsp; Haig, in short, had
been nominated by the Queen, and was the only man on board of
whom the Prince had a wholesome dread.&nbsp; Eliot Yorke, on the
other hand, was the selection of the Royal Alfred.&nbsp; Not that
the Prince was without his appreciation of a practical joke, and
when a fat old gentleman that had been specially invited to a
farewell lunch at one of the foreign stations suddenly discovered
that the ship was under way and a jump into the bumboat
imperative, no laugh was heartier nor louder than that of the
Royal joker.</p>
<p>The Duke, it was said, was one of the best commanders of an
ironclad; he had the technique at his fingers&rsquo; ends, and
knew every bolt and screw from the keel to the upper deck; some
toadies even asserted he was superior to Hornby or Vansittart,
and was a typical British tar in the truest acceptation of the
term.&nbsp; His sympathies, as I have heard him assert, however,
were German to the backbone, and his eyes would fill with tears
when singing some guttural sonnet of the Vaterland.&nbsp; His
marriage brought things to a head, and the curtain was rung down
on Lardy Wilson and all other workers of iniquity after the
garden party at Clarence House in honour of his wedding.</p>
<p>With an excellent piper like Farquharson, engaged to combine
grooming and boot cleaning with <a name="page250"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 250</span>occasional pibrochs and reels, it
may be accepted that H. R. H. was a thorough believer in the
precept that &ldquo;it is more blessed to receive than to
give.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His proficiency as a musician was another fable, and though he
&ldquo;graciously condescended&rdquo; to be first violin at the
Albert Hall Orchestral Society (founded by himself), uncharitable
people are known to have asserted that the royal bow was
soaped.&nbsp; But a point on which no two opinions can exist was
the questionable taste he displayed on one occasion when entering
Simon&rsquo;s Bay.&nbsp; Every commander, as is well known, is
bound to salute the commodore&rsquo;s flag after taking up
moorings; but the Prince had run up the Royal Standard&mdash;and
so the commodore had to salute first.&nbsp; Etiquette demanded
that this should be done&mdash;after, and not before&mdash;and
the &ldquo;reports&rdquo; that followed ended as might be
expected, and the good old sailor was shelved, and a scandal
hushed up that some attributed to von-K&uuml;mmel and others to
less potent causes.</p>
<p>It was the most beautiful woman of the day in the long-ago
fifties&mdash;the Empress of the French&mdash;that introduced the
diabolical &ldquo;appanage&rdquo; known as the crinoline to
conceal her &ldquo;interesting condition,&rdquo; and the peg-top
heels that followed as a consequence, to give height to the
unpleasant beam the crinoline involved on the wearer, were
answerable for more accidents, <i>faux pas</i>, and
unpleasantries than any combination of female adornments before
or since.</p>
<p>Once at St. Peter&rsquo;s, Eaton Square, whose incumbent was
known as Saint Barnabas, a fair worshipper was noticed still in a
devotional attitude when the rest of the congregation had settled
down to the fashionable discourse their souls thirsted for, but
the posture continuing, the verger delicately approached, and
found that nothing more serious had occurred than that her heels
had caught in the hoops and that she was unable to move a
peg.&nbsp; The hopes of an <a name="page251"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 251</span>advertisement over a fashionable
proselyte were thus shattered, and his reverence resumed his
theme.</p>
<p>On another occasion, returning from Cremorne at 2 a.m., when
every cab had been taken, my attention was attracted by a
handsome young cavalier tenderly supporting a fair sinner, who
was leaning trustfully on his shoulder.&nbsp; It appears he had
found her motionless and in tears on an area grating, her heel
through her hoop, and the heel itself wedged as in a vice.&nbsp;
Nothing but prompt action could save the situation, and the last
I saw of the interesting couple was progressing by easy stages
and heading towards Oakley Square.</p>
<p>The same young cavalier might have been recognised not long
since as a grim old warrior, munching a sandwich in the vestibule
of Stafford House after the lev&eacute;e in honour of the Mutiny
heroes!</p>
<p>And the charming lad who was responsible for the introduction
of the diabolical appendage.&nbsp; We all remember the shock that
literally smote every heart when the news of the Prince
Imperial&rsquo;s untimely death reached England.</p>
<p>A youth divested of every suspicion of affectation, possessing
to an inordinate degree that fascination of manner rarely to be
found except amongst the old nobility of France, discarding every
comfort to fight in the ranks of an alien army, to be assegaied
by a handful of Zulus!&nbsp; Was ever such irony of fate for the
great-nephew of Bonaparte, who, had he lived, would assuredly by
his charm have eventually won back his throne.</p>
<p>One voice only struck a discordant note, the overrated Quaker
Solon of Rochdale.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perish India,&rdquo; he once said
in his wisdom.&nbsp; &ldquo;He went out to kill the Zulus, and
the Zulus killed him&rdquo; was this time his funeral
oration.</p>
<p>It was in the early seventies&mdash;if I remember
rightly&mdash;that I had many acquaintances amongst the various
<a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
252</span>embassies and legations, which frequently brought me to
the St. James&rsquo;s, the club of the foreign attach&eacute;s
generally.&nbsp; My most intimate friend was Baron Spaum&mdash;at
the time naval attach&eacute; at the Austrian Embassy&mdash;and
at the present moment Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial Austrian
Navy.&nbsp; I was also familiar with Prince Hohenlohe and Count
Mongela, of the same embassy, and, in a lesser degree, with Count
Beust, son of the Austrian Ambassador.&nbsp; Amongst the Russians
I knew Count Adelberg well, and it was through his
representations that I eventually came into contact with that
wonderful man Count Schouvaloff.&nbsp; Count Paul Schouvaloff at
the time was Russian Ambassador in London.&nbsp; An intimate and
trusted friend of the Czar, his Excellency had filled every
office in his country that called for administrative and
diplomatic talents of the first order.&nbsp; As Chief of the
Secret Police his power was literally absolute and irresponsible;
as governor of a vast province he had ruled almost as an
independent sovereign; and in later years was the ruling
spirit&mdash;and certainly the most difficult nut to
crack&mdash;at the Congress of Berlin, when Lord Beaconsfield was
accredited with having returned with &ldquo;Peace with
Honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was as the guest of this historical personage that I one
day found myself at Chesham House, eating the most delightful
lunch, drinking the rarest Crimean wines, and marvelling at the
courteous, retiring-mannered man who plied me with the most
delicate attentions.</p>
<p>His English, as may be supposed, was faultless, and so it was
that my admiration was turned to astonishment when a personage to
whom I assumed there could be nothing new under the sun asked me
if I would do for him the great favour of piloting him amongst
the sights of London.</p>
<p>Not many nights later a muster of some dozen <a
name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>souls
paraded at my rooms in Charles Street, and as all were
scrupulously attired in pot hats and shooting coats it would have
been difficult for the most observant to have sorted ambassadors
or attach&eacute;s from the less diplomatic clay made in
England.</p>
<p>The muster roll contained the Russian Ambassador, Count
Adelberg, Count Beust, Count Mongela, Baron Spaum, Prince
Hohenlohe, Colonel (Charlie) Norton, Sir Edward Cunynghame (Ned),
the Duke of Hamilton, and my humble self.</p>
<p>The programme had been settled prior to all this with the
assistance of an ex-detective, who made a princely addition to
his slender pension by piloting exploration parties to latitudes
where much depended on diplomacy.</p>
<p>Our first visit was to Turnham&rsquo;s, a pot-house in Newman
Street, where extensive arrangements had been made for some
badger drawing under the personal auspices of Bill George.&nbsp;
In later years this canine authority developed into a trusted
dog-provider to the nobility, and resided in the vicinity of
Kensal Green; at the time of which I write his transactions in
dog-flesh were of a more miscellaneous character, and, as he once
told me with pride, a letter addressed &ldquo;Bill George, Dog
Stealer, London,&rdquo; would reach him without delay.</p>
<p>Our next move was to Jimmy Shaw&rsquo;s, but whether it was to
Windmill Street or to a new house he took when his old place was
demolished (next to the stage door of the Lyric Theatre) I cannot
recollect.</p>
<p>Here rats in sackfuls were awaiting us, amongst others a
rough-haired mongrel terrier, which not long previously had
performed the astounding feat of killing 1,000 rats in an
incredibly short space of time.</p>
<p>To see 1,000 sewer rats not long in captivity together in a
pit, after having seen each one counted out by an expert
rat-catcher diving into a sack, is something <a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>my
enlightened twentieth-century reader will never again see in
London.</p>
<p>For, although not absolutely prohibited, the shadow of Exeter
Hall was already spreading over the land, and the
police&mdash;already tainted&mdash;were not to be trusted, even
when a live ambassador was present.</p>
<p>Tom King&mdash;ex-champion&mdash;had also consented, for a
consideration, to again put on the gloves, and brought with him a
burly opponent; the slogging that ensued was really splendid, and
Count Schouvaloff was literally in ecstasies.</p>
<p>Our next move was to Endell Street, and here greater
precautions were necessary, for cock-fighting was the
unpardonable sin, and the pains and penalties terrible.&nbsp; So
we split into twos and threes, and going by different ways
eventually found ourselves in the cock-pit below ground.</p>
<p>Tom Faultless was the last of the old type of British bulldog
sportsman.&nbsp; Over seventy years old, he had in his youth
assisted at bull-baiting, dog-fights, cock-fighting, and every
sport that once gave unalloyed delight to high and low.</p>
<p>To his able hands the conduct of this particular department
was entrusted; nor were we long in realising that the supply was
more than enough to meet the most extravagant demands, as,
banging the door to, we were assailed by the defiant crows of a
dozen gladiators, and this not far from midnight, when the
denizens of that virtuous quarter were courting gentle sleep, and
sounds carried like steam whistles.</p>
<p>It was close upon 2 a.m. before we again resumed our
pilgrimage, and with the aid of half a dozen four-wheelers wended
our way towards the Mint.</p>
<p>It is unnecessary here to repeat what is fully set out in a
previous chapter, suffice to say our experiences on this occasion
were equally as interesting of those <a name="page255"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 255</span>of &rsquo;62, and that his
Excellency vowed that amid all his miscellaneous experiences
nothing so unique had ever equally delighted him.</p>
<p>Five o&rsquo;clock was striking as we drove past Covent
Garden, and having suggested that excellent eggs and bacon were
to be obtained at Hart&rsquo;s Coffee House, all alighted and all
ate as only diplomatists and night birds can.</p>
<p>As we drove still further West the strings of market carts
wafted the odours of country life and green things into our
debauched nostrils, and we slunk away to our respective homes
more or less delighted with our adventures.</p>
<p>Whilst on the subject of Russian diplomatists a deafening
experience I had a few years later may not be without
interest.</p>
<p>It was on the Grand Duke Alexis&rsquo;s flagship that I had
the honour of finding myself one of some sixty guests.&nbsp; In
addition to the Russian battleship there were men-of-war of
England, France, and Sweden in the harbour, and the Grand Duke
was presiding at the table.</p>
<p>Needless to describe the excellent cookery&mdash;for Russian
cookery is very difficult to beat&mdash;nor the choice Crimean
wines, many of which are unobtainable except at the Imperial
table, but when the dinner was over the row <i>literally</i>
began.</p>
<p>First the Grand Duke proposed the Czar&rsquo;s health,
smashing the glass so that no less worthy toast should again
defile it, and 101 guns began a salute on the deck immediately
over our heads.</p>
<p>Barely had it ceased when the battleships of England, France,
and Sweden followed&mdash;not simultaneously, but one after
another&mdash;and again the Grand Duke arose and proposed the
Queen of England to a repetition of the same diabolical
accompaniment.&nbsp; And then followed the toast to the rulers of
France and Sweden till the viands we had consumed seemed to <a
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>rattle in
their astonishment, and our heads to whirl with after-dinner
loyalty.</p>
<p>And when the adjournment to the main deck for coffee and
cigarettes took place, it is no exaggeration to assert that we
waded ankle deep through broken glass.</p>
<p>The impetus given to that industry must have been
enormous!</p>
<h2><a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
257</span>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">DHULEEP SINGH&mdash;AND FIFTY YEARS
AFTER.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> must pass back to the fifties to
introduce a personage who figures conspicuously in the sixties
and seventies, both in comedy and tragedy, and then shuffled off
this mortal coil and has long since been forgotten.</p>
<p>It was in &rsquo;56 when England had annexed Oude, that the
ex-Queen and a considerable retinue arrived in London to
&ldquo;protest&rdquo;&mdash;a process that must have enlightened,
if it did not benefit, them in the ways of Imperial Policy.</p>
<p>Half-a-dozen houses in Marylebone Road were secured as a
temporary palace, and it was thither, as a lad, that I
accompanied my father, who had once held high office in the
Punjaub.</p>
<p>The exact spot was where the Baker Street station now stands,
and as one is nothing unless one is accurate, conceive entering
the present dismal premises and finding in the &ldquo;reception
room&rdquo; two or three beds, in one of which was the Queen;
about the floor various courtiers were littered, whilst the
atmosphere was so sour that one felt thankful the old
woman&rsquo;s reign had been cut short, and that henceforth
sanitary arrangements, a tub, and other adjuncts of Christianity
would prevail in Oude after the family had realised that
&ldquo;No mistakes were rectified after leaving the
counter,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you wish you may get
it?&rdquo; embodied our beneficent policy in the abstract.</p>
<p><a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>Baker
Street at the time swarmed with Mohammedans, for, by a
coincidence, Lord Panmure, the Earl of Dalhousie, and Sir John
Lawrence&mdash;all more or less associated with India&mdash;had
houses in that then fashionable neighbourhood, and so enabled the
&ldquo;protesters&rdquo; to combine business with pleasure at
comparatively slight physical inconvenience.</p>
<p>Dhuleep Singh, another reputed Punjaubee, had also at this
time been brought to England, and, although then pursuing the
ordinary course of a schoolboy under General Oliphant, it was
only later, as a Norfolk landlord, a masher, a burlesque
conspirator, and the owner of the finest emeralds in the world,
that he came into prominence.</p>
<p>It is in these latter roles that we purpose to interest our
readers.</p>
<p>During the minority of this most fortunate Asiatic the savings
out of his annuity of &pound;40,000 a year had amounted to a
colossal sum, and so Dhuleep Singh first comes into prominence,
on attaining his majority, as a Norfolk squire and the owner of
Elvedon Hall.</p>
<p>An excellent shot, it was some few years later that he made
the sportsmanlike wager with Lord Sefton to slaughter a thousand
head of game within a day.&nbsp; Rabbits were included in the
bet, and impossible as such a feat may appear, the tameness of
the pheasants in the over-stocked home preserves made it quite
feasible.&nbsp; For some reason, however, it never came off.</p>
<p>At this period the Maharajah was in high favour at Court; his
children, after his marriage with the unpretentious little lady
he wooed and won at Singapore, were permitted to play with
British Royal sprigs, and the Heir-apparent invariably had a
week&rsquo;s shooting with his dusky neighbour and a suitably
selected party in the autumn.</p>
<p>But despite the glamour these reunions may be supposed to have
spread over him Dhuleep Singh had ever an eye to business, and a
contract was made <a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
259</span>with Baily, the poulterer in Mount Street, for a
shilling a head all round for all surplus hares, rabbits,
pheasants, and what-not slaughtered at Elvedon Hall.</p>
<p>The Maharajah&rsquo;s behaviour meanwhile was all that was
desirable.&nbsp; At Court functions he was resplendent in
emeralds and diamonds, and the slab, six inches by four, on his
swordbelt was said to be the finest emerald in the world.</p>
<p>The jewellers to whom was deputed the task of cutting,
setting, and otherwise improving the barbaric gems of the
youthful prince are said to trace their present Bond Street
position to this fortunate selection.</p>
<p>It was only when his Highness assumed evening dress that
visions of Mooltan, Chilianwallah, and Goojerat faded from
one&rsquo;s brain, and a podgy little Hindoo seemed to stand
before one, divested of that physique and martial bearing one
associates with either warriors or Sikhs, and only requiring, as
it were, a chutnee-pot peeping out of his pocket to complete the
illusion.</p>
<p>During the sixties and seventies Dhuleep Singh was in evidence
everywhere.&nbsp; An excellent whist player amongst such admitted
champions as Goldingham, Dupplin, &ldquo;Cavendish&rdquo; (on
whist), and others, he was to be found every afternoon at the
Marlborough, or East India, or Whist Club backing his opinion,
and damning his partner if he ignored his &ldquo;call for
trumps;&rdquo; whilst every evening found him at the Alhambra
graciously accepting the homage of the houris in the green-room,
and distributing 9-carat gimcracks with Oriental lavishness.</p>
<p>During this period apparently the Punjaub occupied only a
secondary position in his mind, and we next find him occupying a
spacious flat in King Street, Covent Garden, and it was there,
doubtless, that visions of charging at the head of the splendid
horsemen of the Punjaub and the wresting of India from British <a
name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>rule first
entered his romantic brain; for the Maharajah was a poet, though
happily none of his effusions appear to have been
preserved.&nbsp; He may also have recollected that the Koh-i-noor
was once a crown jewel of Runjeet Singh, and his Highness was
passionately found of baubles.</p>
<p>Often have I seen him of an evening pacing to and fro outside
the &ldquo;Shirt Shop&rdquo; (as the Whist Club was
affectionately called) maturing those foolish plans that deprived
him of his income for a while and led him into straits that it is
painful to realise.&nbsp; Occasionally, indeed, he would rave at
the injustice of the beggarly income the Government of India
accorded him, and then it was he conceived the brilliant idea of
coquetting with Russia for the simultaneous rising of the Punjaub
and a Russian invasion of India.</p>
<p>Not that one Sikh would have stirred at his call, and his
proclamation fizzed and went out like any squib at a Brock
benefit.&nbsp; Added to this, Russia rucked on him and his
Highness fell into disgrace.</p>
<p>But still his vanity led him on, and he essayed to start for
India, and shipped as Pat Casey, though why Pat, and what part of
Ireland Casey hailed from will ever remain an unfathomable
mystery.</p>
<p>The hero, however, never got beyond Aden, where he was
politely invited to retrace his steps.&nbsp; The &ldquo;last
phase&rdquo; was as brief as it was lamentable.&nbsp; Settling in
Paris he again married.&nbsp; Then poverty necessitated the sale
of his jewels, sickness overtook him, and, broken in body and
mind, he asked and received pardon for his many foolish acts.</p>
<p>After his escapades in Paris he is said to have written to the
British Government, &ldquo;<i>Capivi</i>,&rdquo; evidently
intending to reiterate the cypher telegram attributed to Sir
Charles Napier, the conqueror of Scinde,
&ldquo;<i>Peccavi</i>&rdquo; (a mot that will appeal to all
classical readers).&nbsp; Thereupon he was forgiven, and <a
name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>shortly
after he died, and so the race of the &ldquo;Lion of the
Punjaub&rdquo; went out like a lamb.</p>
<p>What became of the second wife I never heard, what became of
the Alhambra lass and the dusky tadpoles that drove about the
King&rsquo;s Road at Brighton history does not tell, for
&ldquo;Love is a queer thing, it comes and it goes,&rdquo; and
all that remains to the present generation is the nebulous tale
of a misguided man who kicked down wealth, position, and a happy
old age in the reckless pursuit of a silly ambition.</p>
<h3>FIFTY YEARS AFTER.</h3>
<p>I cannot permit this opportunity to pass without reminding
every reader of the momentous issues that were for ever set at
rest by the incredible heroism of our army during the Mutiny in
September fifty years ago, and without encroaching on the
beautiful story by W. H. Fitchett, within the reach of everybody
for 4&frac12;d., one may legitimately ask why many incidents that
then occurred have never been explained.</p>
<p>What is the <i>true</i> version of the &ldquo;<i>Stone</i>
Bridge&rdquo; being left <i>open</i> at Lucknow?</p>
<p>Why is it invariably confused with the &ldquo;<i>Iron</i>
Bridge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What was the <i>true</i> reason of the Cawnpore reverse?</p>
<p>No history yet written has ever explained these points, which,
however justifiable at the time, may surely, after fifty years,
have light thrown upon them, and if Lord Roberts would give his
version, many&mdash;including the old brigade&mdash;would have
their curiosity set at rest.</p>
<p>And touching those glorious days, what return has a grateful
(!) country made to the remnant that remains?&nbsp; An invitation
to a lev&eacute;e and a sandwich and a photographed group
afterwards!&nbsp; A 5th Class Victorian Order would have left
nothing to be desired.&nbsp; <a name="page262"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 262</span>For my part if I pass a drummer boy
of the brave 93rd I feel an irresistible inclination to raise my
hat in homage to a successor of those invincible
Highlanders.&nbsp; And then the irony of it!&nbsp; MacBean, the
adjutant who passed through those continuous hurricanes of shot
and shell without a scratch, died of lock-jaw, when in command of
the regiment some twenty years after, from cutting a corn.</p>
<p>Every patriot will forgive a digression on the day (December
6th) these lines are being written, for it is a landmark in the
annals of the Army as recording the <i>last</i> occasion (fifty
years ago) that British infantry advanced in line in old
Peninsular formation&mdash;in slow time&mdash;halting
periodically and dressing on their coverers as we see on a Hyde
Park parade, under a terrific fire of shot and shrapnel, and
then, breaking into the old-fashioned charge, the irresistible
cheer, and cold steel as a climax.</p>
<p>For on that decisive day the Gwalior contingent, 80,000
strong, splendidly drilled, the flower of the Sepoy Army, was
shattered by Colin Campbell and his handful of 3,400 men, and the
neck of the great Mutiny was broken.</p>
<p>No man living to-day who heard that crumpling sound and that
avenging cheer can ever&mdash;will ever&mdash;forget it, and it
behoves you, my masters, to remember, when you see the red and
white-striped ribbon on the mendicant selling matches, or his
more fortunate comrade patrolling outside a shop door, that in
the words of Colin Campbell: &ldquo;Every man of them that day
was worth his weight in gold to England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here one is reminded of a German prejudice of the Dowager
Queen Adelaide (whom we all prayed for in our youth), who at
lev&eacute;es and Court functions insisted on kilted officers
appearing in &ldquo;trews&rdquo;&mdash;the absence of the
&ldquo;breeks&rdquo; being too shockingly shocking.</p>
<p><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>And
whilst on this subject I am reminded, by the recent death of
George FitzGeorge at Lucerne, of many incidents more or less
military.</p>
<p>At Gibraltar as late as &rsquo;65 was a sentry posted on a
promontory that originally commanded a view of the
Straits&mdash;but which a high wall had subsequently
obliterated&mdash;whose orders were &ldquo;To keep a sharp look
out and immediately to report if the Spanish fleet was in
sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Governor at the time was Sir Richard Airey, the most
courteous of the old English school of gentlemen, but probably
the worst Quartermaster-General that ever permitted boots and
blankets to accumulate at Balaclava and brave men to freeze and
starve at the front.&nbsp; It was an inspiration of his to
utilise the stores with which Gibraltar is permanently
provisioned by a periodical issue of salt pork rations that had
accumulated since the Crimean War.&nbsp; Needless to add, much
was mouldy, and many the complaints, and on one occasion when a
vehement report reached him, he replied: &ldquo;Leave it here, it
shall be seen to.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not long after invitations were
issued for a dinner at the Convent, to which the
&ldquo;Board&rdquo; on the rotten pork were invited.</p>
<p>The banquet was the finest a French cook could produce, and
one dish with &ldquo;<i>Sauce Robert</i>&rdquo; especially
appreciated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, gentlemen, is your rotten pork, and shows you how
some men are never satisfied,&rdquo; was his Excellency&rsquo;s
appropriate (!) comment.&nbsp; But there is not a <i>cordon
bleu</i> in every regimental cook-house.</p>
<h2><a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE LAST OF THE OLD BRIGADE.</span></h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">will</span> now relate as a fitting end
to these long reminiscences what I witnessed forty years ago in
the island of Mauritius, when death was having a fine harvest by
the ravages of a plague, and how a hurricane&mdash;terrific in
even that so-called focus of hurricanes, and compared with which
the storms we occasionally encounter in Merrie England are but
gentle zephyrs&mdash;obliterated all the germs of infection.</p>
<p>It was in &rsquo;67 that a terrible epidemic&mdash;new to
science&mdash;burst without warning on the beautiful island of
Mauritius.&nbsp; Its very symptoms were unfamiliar to the
faculty, and so, for a better name, it was called jungle
fever.&nbsp; Fever and ague were its chief characteristics,
followed by absolute prostration, and death with alarming
rapidity.</p>
<p>Like its dread ally cholera, its first appearance was
irresistible; then the attack became less formidable, and as the
atmosphere became saturated with its poisonous germs, every
living thing suffered from exhaustion, and man and beast
literally dragged one leg after another, and almost prayed for
release.</p>
<p>The scourge, it was supposed, had been introduced by the
100,000 Madras coolies who worked on the sugar plantations under
conditions as nearly approaching slavery as our beneficent
Government would admit.</p>
<p>It was under these depressing circumstances that a British
regiment, 800 strong, and in the best of health, was landed, and
within a month not 100 <a name="page265"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 265</span>would have been available for
duty.&nbsp; Not daring to keep them in Port Louis, where the
deaths were some 400 a day, the regiment was split into fragments
and billeted wherever an empty outhouse or a few obsolete tents
could afford temporary shelter.&nbsp; But the ingenuity of the
inefficient staff in no way averted the danger, and within a
month a dozen minor centres were created, where British soldiers
succumbed and died who ought never to have been disembarked.</p>
<p>Not an officer who was sufficiently well but had to read the
burial service almost daily over Protestant and Catholic
comrades, and not a drum was heard whilst the scant ceremony was
being repeated and repeated in its terrible monotony.</p>
<p>To make matters worse quinine, which ordinarily costs a few
pence, was selling at auction at &pound;30 per ounce.&nbsp; Then
the supply ran out, and so valuable did the drug become that the
dose a dying man&rsquo;s stomach could not retain was carefully
bottled up for the next urgent case.</p>
<p>Soon the very wood for coffins ran short, and the carpenters
who made the ghastly necessaries were themselves dead or dying,
so long trenches were improvised in which the dead were laid in
rows.</p>
<p>Every house bewailed a departed relative, for there was no
pitying angel to sprinkle the door-posts in that remote isle of
the sea, and the sound of wailing went up from Indian compound
and European cantonment alike as, smiting their breasts, the cry
ascended to Brahmah and the God of the Christians to stay the
hand of the destroying angel.</p>
<p>Truly the grasshopper had become a burden and desire failed,
when a change as sudden as the arrival of the terrible scourge
ensued, and a hurricane, unprecedented in its violence, swept
over the island for days.</p>
<p>Fields of sugar cane, ripe for the sickle, were laid low in a
twinkling; houses were unroofed, and tents <a
name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>blown into
space; huge bridges were twisted like corkscrews, and bolts
weighing a ton were hurled about like cricket balls.&nbsp; A
heavily-laden goods train, standing outside the station (as
instanced by the Governor in his official report), was turned on
its side, and, joy of joy, the terrible plague and its insidious
germs were wafted into eternity.&nbsp; And when the death roll
was called a few months later, what a cloud of victims did it
show!&nbsp; Bishop Hatchard, not long arrived, whose funeral I
attended; the General, who came home to die; the wives and
daughters of many it is needless to recapitulate, and brave
soldiers innumerable discharged as medically unfit or still
sleeping in that distant oasis of the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>But even this awful drama has associations that lend
themselves to comedy.&nbsp; A representative of a Deep Sea Cable
Company, who was conspicuous for his flowing mane and
superabundant hair, emerged from his illness as smooth as a
billiard ball, and the local snuff-coloured wig he donned to hide
his nakedness was as bewildering as it was irresistible.</p>
<p>The coolies, too, desirous of apprising their friends in
Madras of their safety, and thinking it a favourable opportunity
to defraud the Revenue, would slip unstamped letters into the
post, oblivious of the columns of names that appeared weekly in
the local paper as not having been forwarded in consequence of
insufficient postage.&nbsp; And then the Creoles&mdash;a
snuff-and-butter combination of English, French, and
Indian&mdash;desirous of airing their European pretensions, would
hail one with: &ldquo;Ah, the plague&mdash;we are now far from
IT,&rdquo; or, anxious to be polite, would add: &ldquo;I have
heard your name with great advantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sitting round a blazing fire some few years ago at Christmas,
in the comfortable chambers (since demolished) at the corner of
Hanover Square and George Street, three friends were discussing
the various changes they had witnessed together in the <a
name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>past forty
years.&nbsp; Not that the conversation was unattended with
drawbacks, for a gang of &ldquo;waits&rdquo; were disseminating
discord through the still hours of the night.&nbsp; An asthmatic
harmonium was the chief culprit, and bore on its back the
blasphemous inscription, &ldquo;Let everything that hath breath
praise the Lord,&rdquo; the remainder of the orchestra being a
clarionet and a fiddle; all the operators had red noses, and the
instruments suffered accordingly.&nbsp; A public-house within
measurable distance may explain the welcome silence that
occasionally intervened and justify the assumption that it was
responsible for the discord.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, &ldquo;The voice that breathed o&rsquo;er
Eden&rdquo;&mdash;with whisky variations&mdash;does not lend
itself to concentration of thought or deed, save of an irreverent
kind, so I will conclude by describing my companions whom
we&rsquo;ve frequently met in our various rambles.</p>
<p>Of these, one was a country-looking squire with grey hair and
cropped beard, who, on closer inspection, was recognisable as the
wiry bruiser who had thrashed the &ldquo;Kangaroo&rdquo; thirty
years previously at the Alhambra; the other was Bobby Shafto,
still erect and soldier-like, but divested of the curly locks
that had won their way into everybody&rsquo;s favour a decade
previously.</p>
<p>For Bobby had only just left the Service, after holding a
series of personal staff appointments through the influence of
powerful friends of the days of his youth.</p>
<p>So great, indeed, had been his interest at the Horse Guards
that&mdash;admittedly, the worst of company officers&mdash;he was
discovered to possess military talents of the highest
order.&nbsp; He was &ldquo;a born leader of men&rdquo; it was
asserted; he had a &ldquo;capacity for organisation&rdquo; and
for &ldquo;licking a hopeless rabble into a military
force.&rdquo;&nbsp; Had he continued soldiering he would <a
name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>doubtless
have been covered with &ldquo;orders,&rdquo; appointed Governor
of one of our important fortresses, given the command of an Army
Corps, or created a peer&mdash;as many an amiable donkey with
interest has been before and since.</p>
<p>But both these good fellows have since passed away, and
I&mdash;only I&mdash;remain&mdash;like a modern Elijah&mdash;to
commune within myself of the various incidents with which we were
associated in the long-ago sixties.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
